Malaysia emerged as a major destination for U.S. waste after China banned American waste imports in 2018. California shipped 864 shipping containers, or more than 10 million pounds of plastic waste, to Malaysia in 2024, according to the Basel Action Network, an advocacy group. That was second only to Georgia among U.S. states. 

Under Malaysian waste guidelines announced last month, the country will no longer accept plastic waste and hazardous waste from nations that didn't ratify the Basel Convention, the international treaty designed to reduce the international movement of hazardous and other waste.

This ecosystem includes our family of over a dozen specialized models for everything from safeguarding to medical applications and, most inspiringly, the countless innovations from the community. From innovators like Roboflow building enterprise computer vision to the Institute of Science Tokyo creating highly-capable Japanese Gemma variants, your work has shown us the path forward.Building on this incredible momentum, we're excited to announce the full release of Gemma 3n. While last month's preview offered a glimpse, today unlocks the full power of this mobile-first architecture. Gemma 3n is designed for the developer community that helped shape Gemma. It’s supported by your favorite tools including Hugging Face Transformers, llama.cpp, Google AI Edge, Ollama, MLX, and many others, enabling you to fine-tune and deploy for your specific on-device applications with ease. This post is the developer deep dive: we'll explore some of the innovations behind Gemma 3n, share new benchmark results, and show you how to start building today.Gemma 3n represents a major advancement for on-device AI, bringing powerful multimodal capabilities to edge devices with performance previously only seen in last year's cloud-based frontier models. Gemma 3n natively supports image, audio, video, and text inputs and text outputs. Engineered with a focus on efficiency, Gemma 3n models are available in two sizes based on  parameters: E2B and E4B. While their raw parameter count is 5B and 8B respectively, architectural innovations allow them to run with a memory footprint comparable to traditional 2B and 4B models, operating with as little as 2GB (E2B) and 3GB (E4B) of memory.Groundbreaking architecture: At its core, Gemma 3n features novel components like the MatFormer architecture for compute flexibility, Per Layer Embeddings (PLE) for memory efficiency, and new audio and MobileNet-v5 based vision encoders optimized for on-device use cases. Gemma 3n delivers quality improvements across multilinguality (supporting 140 languages for text and multimodal understanding of 35 languages), math, coding, and reasoning. The E4B version achieves an LMArena score over 1300, making it the first model under 10 billion parameters to reach this benchmark.Achieving this leap in on-device performance required rethinking the model from the ground up. The foundation is Gemma 3n’s unique mobile-first architecture, and it all starts with MatFormer.At the core of Gemma 3n is the  (🪆Matryoshka Transformer), a novel nested transformer built for elastic inference. Think of it like Matryoshka dolls: a larger model contains smaller, fully functional versions of itself. This approach extends the concept of Matryoshka Representation Learning from just embeddings to all transformer components.During the MatFormer training of the 4B effective parameter (E4B) model, a 2B effective parameter (E2B) sub-model is simultaneously optimized within it, as shown in the figure above. This provides developers two powerful capabilities and use cases today:1: You can directly download and use either the main E4B model for the highest capabilities, or the standalone E2B sub-model which we have already extracted for you, offering up to 2x faster inference.2: Custom sizes with Mix-n-Match: For more granular control tailored to specific hardware constraints, you can create a spectrum of custom-sized models between E2B and E4B using a method we call Mix-n-Match. This technique allows you to precisely slice the E4B model's parameters, primarily by adjusting the feed forward network hidden dimension per layer (from 8192 to 16384) and selectively skipping some layers. We are releasing the MatFormer Lab, a tool that shows how to retrieve these optimal models, which were identified by evaluating various settings on benchmarks like MMLU.Looking ahead, the MatFormer architecture also paves the way for. While not part of today’s launched implementations, this capability allows a single deployed E4B model to dynamically switch between E4B and E2B inference paths on the fly, enabling real-time optimization of performance and memory usage based on the current task and device load.Per-Layer Embeddings (PLE): Unlocking more memory efficiencyGemma 3n models incorporate Per-Layer Embeddings (PLE). This innovation is tailored for on-device deployment as it dramatically improves model quality without increasing the high-speed memory footprint required on your device's accelerator (GPU/TPU).While the Gemma 3n E2B and E4B models have a total parameter count of 5B and 8B respectively, PLE allows a significant portion of these parameters (the embeddings associated with each layer) to be loaded and computed efficiently on the CPU. This means only the core transformer weights (approximately 2B for E2B and 4B for E4B) need to sit in the typically more constrained accelerator memory (VRAM).KV Cache sharing: Faster long-context processingProcessing long inputs, such as the sequences derived from audio and video streams, is essential for many advanced on-device multimodal applications. Gemma 3n introduces KV Cache Sharing, a feature designed to significantly accelerate time-to-first-token for streaming response applications.KV Cache Sharing optimizes how the model handles the initial input processing stage (often called the "prefill" phase). The keys and values of the middle layer from local and global attention are directly shared with all the top layers, delivering a notable 2x improvement on prefill performance compared to Gemma 3 4B. This means the model can ingest and understand lengthy prompt sequences much faster than before.Audio understanding: Introducing speech to text and translationGemma 3n uses an advanced audio encoder based on the Universal Speech Model (USM). The encoder generates a token for every 160ms of audio (about 6 tokens per second), which are then integrated as input to the language model, providing a granular representation of the sound context.This integrated audio capability unlocks key features for on-device development, including:Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR): Enable high-quality speech-to-text transcription directly on the device.Automatic Speech Translation (AST): Translate spoken language into text in another language.We've observed particularly strong AST results for translation between English and Spanish, French, Italian, and Portuguese, offering great potential for developers targeting applications in these languages. For tasks like speech translation, leveraging Chain-of-Thought prompting can significantly enhance results. Here’s an example:<bos><start_of_turn>user
Transcribe the following speech segment in Spanish, then translate it into English: 
<start_of_audio><end_of_turn>
<start_of_turn>modelAt launch time, the Gemma 3n encoder is implemented to process audio clips up to 30 seconds. However, this is not a fundamental limitation. The underlying audio encoder is a streaming encoder, capable of processing arbitrarily long audios with additional long form audio training. Follow-up implementations will unlock low-latency, long streaming applications.MobileNet-V5: New state-of-the-art vision encoderAlongside its integrated audio capabilities, Gemma 3n features a new, highly efficient vision encoder, , delivering state-of-the-art performance for multimodal tasks on edge devices.Designed for flexibility and power on constrained hardware, MobileNet-V5 gives developers:Multiple input resolutions: Natively supports resolutions of 256x256, 512x512, and 768x768 pixels, allowing you to balance performance and detail for your specific applications.Broad visual understanding: Co-trained on extensive multimodal datasets, it excels at a wide range of image and video comprehension tasks.: Processes up to 60 frames per second on a Google Pixel, enabling real-time, on-device video analysis and interactive experiences.This level of performance is achieved with multiple architectural innovations, including:An advanced foundation of MobileNet-V4 blocks (including Universal Inverted Bottlenecks and Mobile MQA).A significantly scaled up architecture, featuring a hybrid, deep pyramid model that is 10x larger than the biggest MobileNet-V4 variant.A novel Multi-Scale Fusion VLM adapter that enhances the quality of tokens for better accuracy and efficiency.Benefiting from novel architectural designs and advanced distillation techniques, MobileNet-V5-300M substantially outperforms the baseline SoViT in Gemma 3 (trained with SigLip, no distillation). On a Google Pixel Edge TPU, it delivers a 13x speedup with quantization (6.5x without), requires 46% fewer parameters, and has a 4x smaller memory footprint, all while providing significantly higher accuracy on vision-language tasksWe’re excited to share more about the work behind this model. Look out for our upcoming MobileNet-V5 technical report, which will deep dive into the model architecture, data scaling strategies, and advanced distillation techniques.Making Gemma 3n accessible from day one has been a priority. We're proud to partner with many incredible open source developers to ensure broad support across popular tools and platforms, including contributions from teams behind AMD, Axolotl, Docker, Hugging Face, llama.cpp, LMStudio, MLX, NVIDIA, Ollama, RedHat, SGLang, Unsloth, and vLLM.But this ecosystem is just the beginning. The true power of this technology is in what you will build with it. That’s why we’re launching the Gemma 3n Impact Challenge.

[This documentary was originally released in 2020]

Since the Islamic Republic of Iran was founded in 1979, there has been a war between Iran, Israel and the US. The war has never been officially declared, and there has been no real reconciliation.

Part One of this two-part documentary focuses on the origins of the conflict between Iran and Israel. It began when the Israelis invaded Lebanon to confront a new Lebanese Shiite force backed by Iran: Hezbollah.

Throughout the Middle East, targeted assassinations, bombings, and non-military attacks with no clear attribution are on the rise. Could the "secret war" between Iran and Israel escalate into a major regional or even global confrontation? The two countries are dominant powers in today’s Middle East. Yet Iran and Israel have failed to resolve their historical disputes, and there has never been significant dialogue between them. And what role does the United States play in the conflict? 

Based on painstaking archival research and featuring high-profile players in Israel, Iran, Lebanon and the US, the film looks back on the more than forty years since Iran’s Islamic Revolution. It explores key moments and provides ways of understanding the new Middle East.

You have to keep them safe (obviously), while at the same time you need to integrate with a ton of different systems and always provide a great user-experience, because otherwise people will just find a way around your system.
When talking to peers, a lot of people mention 1Password as a company that nailed this balance.In today’s episode, I talk to Andrew about how 1Password uses Rust to build critical systems that must never fail, how Rust helps them handle secrets for millions of users, and the lessons they learned when adopting Rust in their stack.

The Dublin-based firm, which made its fortune advising clients on adapting to new technologies from the internet to cloud computing, now confronts the same predicament as generative AI reshapes business operations. 

The company's new generative AI contracts slowed to $100 million in the most recent quarter, down from $200 million per quarter last year. Technology partners including Microsoft and SAP are increasingly integrating AI directly into their offerings, allowing systems to work immediately without extensive consulting support. Newcomers like Palantir are embedding their own engineers with customers, enabling clients to bypass traditional consultants. 

Between 2015 and 2024, Accenture generated a 370% total return by helping companies navigate technological transitions. The firm reached a $250 billion valuation in February before losing $60 billion in market value. CEO Julie Sweet insists that the company is reorganizing around "reinvention services." A recent survey found 42% of companies abandoned most AI initiatives, up from 17% a year ago.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Ray Dalio Identifies Top Talent</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/nKUwkdiOZAc</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/nKUwkdiOZAc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 16:01:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[How does Ray Dalio identify top talent?

[This documentary was originally released in 2020]

Since the Islamic Republic of Iran was founded in 1979, there has been a war between Iran, Israel and the US. The war has never been officially declared, and there has been no real reconciliation.

Part One of this two-part documentary focuses on the origins of the conflict between Iran and Israel. It began when the Israelis invaded Lebanon to confront a new Lebanese Shiite force backed by Iran: Hezbollah.

Throughout the Middle East, targeted assassinations, bombings, and non-military attacks with no clear attribution are on the rise. Could the "secret war" between Iran and Israel escalate into a major regional or even global confrontation? The two countries are dominant powers in today’s Middle East. Yet Iran and Israel have failed to resolve their historical disputes, and there has never been significant dialogue between them. And what role does the United States play in the conflict? 

Based on painstaking archival research and featuring high-profile players in Israel, Iran, Lebanon and the US, the film looks back on the more than forty years since Iran’s Islamic Revolution. It explores key moments and provides ways of understanding the new Middle East.

Getting PRs with random eBPF programs copy-pasted from Medium articles, zero comments, and when I ask "what does this actually do?" I get "it's for observability" like that explains anything. Had someone deploy a Falco rule monitoring every syscall on the cluster. Performance tanked, took 3 hours to debug, and their response was "but the tutorial said it was best practice." Another team just deployed some Cilium eBPF config into prod because "it worked in kind." Now we have packet drops and nobody knows why because nobody actually understands what they deployed. When did everyone become an eBPF expert? Last month half these people didn't know what a syscall was. Starting to think we need to treat eBPF like Helm charts - proper review, testing, docs. But apparently I'm an asshole for suggesting we shouldn't just YOLO kernel-level code into production. Anyone else dealing with this? How do you stop people from cargo-culting eBPF configs?

But does it still hold? The alliance is gearing up for the biggest rearmament in its history.
NATO wants its members to spend 5% of their national economic output on defense. Donald Trump is pushing hard for Europe to step up—but is he leading by example? He’s taken unilateral military action in Iran and even threatened to pull the U.S. out of NATO altogether. Meanwhile, Russia keeps bombing Ukraine and waging cyber and propaganda battles across Europe. 

On To the Point we ask: NATO in times of war: Security at all costs?

Most exciting for Linux users with next month's Firefox 141 release is finally lowering system RAM use! I've been running some benchmarks looking at the impact.With this week's release of Firefox 141 Beta, it notes an exciting change for Linux users:"On Linux Firefox uses less memory and no longer requires a forced restart after an update has been applied by a package manager."Less memory use by Firefox on Linux is certainly welcome as it's become quite bloated... I've grown frustrated myself with the direction of Firefox and the insane RAM use in recent times. While being a long time Firefox user since the Firebird days, I've contemplated switching to Chrome given the rampant memory use of Firefox on Linux with my 64GB RAM laptop triggering the OOM daemon routinely due to excessive memory use with Firefox.Thus with the Firefox 141 Beta release, I was curious to run some benchmarks of Firefox 140 vs. Firefox 141 Beta on a test system for seeing the difference.With this testing I was just looking at the single-tab/window impact for reproducibility while running various web browser benchmarks but that alone was enough to show a nice improvement over Firefox 140.This round of benchmarks were done on an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X desktop running Ubuntu 25.04 with the Linux 6.15 kernel and NVIDIA graphics.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What’s Keeping the Fed on Hold? | Presented by CME Group</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzp2Vjuuti8</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/zzp2Vjuuti8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 15:33:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[At its June meeting the Fed left its official interest rate unchanged for the fourth consecutive time.

In this video we're following NASA's Lucy spacecraft on its journey to Jupiter's mysterious Trojan asteroids. Lucy has already stunned scientists by visiting the tiniest main-belt asteroid and discovering its oddly-shaped moon - the first contact-binary satellite ever found! Lucy will reach the Trojan swarm in 2027, hoping these ancient time capsules can shed light on our solar system's formation: What are these ancient rocks made of? Where did they come from? And can they unlock the keys to understanding our own cosmic origins?

World Is Betting on It.What if there were an internet where you, as a human, were always in the fast lane, never stuck in traffic behind armies of automated bots? This isn't a hypothetical question for World, the ambitious project formerly known as Worldcoin. With the launch of its blockchain, World Chain, the company has introduced a radical new concept: Priority Blockspace for Humans (PBH). It is a direct attempt to solve one of the most persistent problems in the crypto world, network congestion caused by bots, and to create a digital world where human users are the top priority. For its 13 million verified users, this could mean a fundamentally fairer and more reliable online experience.\
The core idea of blockchain technology was to create decentralized and open networks. However, anyone who has tried to make a transaction on popular blockchains like Ethereum during peak times knows the frustration. Transaction fees, known as gas fees, can skyrocket as users compete to have their transactions processed. This system often favors those with the most capital, including automated bots designed to snatch up limited digital goods or manipulate markets, pushing out regular users. World’s new system aims to flip this model on its head. Instead of a bidding war, it uses a person's verified humanity as the ultimate pass to the front of the line, ensuring that during high traffic, it is the human users who are served first, not the bots.\
This is made possible through World ID, the project's controversial yet core component. To get a World ID, a user must have their iris scanned by a physical device called an Orb. This process is designed to create a "proof of personhood," a digital verification that a user is a unique human being and not a bot or a duplicate account. With the launch of World Chain, this proof of personhood is now being used to grant privileged access. During periods of heavy network traffic, a specific portion of each block, the digital bundles of data that make up a blockchain, is reserved exclusively for transactions coming from these Orb-verified humans. This ensures that essential activities, from verifying one's identity to using applications on the network, remain smooth and inexpensive for people.A New Set of Rules for the Digital EconomyThe introduction of Priority Blockspace for Humans represents a significant technical and philosophical shift for blockchain infrastructure. It moves away from a purely economic model, where network priority is bought, to a model based on identity. "By granting real human transactions built-in priority during block production, Priority Blockspace for Humans effectively makes World Chain fairer and more efficient," said Steven Smith, Vice President of Engineering and Protocol at Tools for Humanity, a key contributor to the World project. This baked-in priority means that verified users are shielded from the wild fee swings that plague other networks, creating a more predictable and user-friendly environment.\
To understand the impact, consider the example of claiming a digital grant or purchasing a popular, limited-edition item on a traditional blockchain. In such a scenario, bots can be programmed to flood the network with transactions, driving up fees and making it nearly impossible for a human user to succeed without paying an exorbitant price. World Chain’s PBH system is designed to neutralize this threat. The reserved blockspace acts as a dedicated lane for humans, allowing their transactions to be processed quickly and without the extra cost, regardless of bot activity. "We firmly believe that humans and AI can coexist harmoniously," Smith added, "and this development reflects our commitment to building user-friendly systems that benefit humanity while also making the most of bleeding-edge technology.”\
The technology behind this was not built in a vacuum. It was tested on an incentivized testnet, a trial environment that rewards participants for stress-testing the system, with input from leading blockchain research and development firms like Flashbots and Alchemy. The core components, including PBH and Rollup Boost, a tool that allows for this custom ordering of transactions, have been made open-source. This means anyone can inspect the code, a move intended to build trust and encourage wider adoption. Furthermore, the entire system underwent an independent security audit by Nethermind, a respected blockchain auditing firm, to ensure its integrity and security.Building on a Foundation for a Billion UsersWorld Chain itself is what is known as a Layer-2 network. In simple terms, think of it as a highway built on top of a more secure, but slower, main road. The main road, in this case, is Ethereum, one of the largest and most secure blockchains. By processing transactions on its own "layer" and then bundling them to be secured by Ethereum, World Chain can offer significantly faster and cheaper transactions than Ethereum itself could handle alone. This architecture is built using the OP Stack, a standardized and open-source framework that is part of a larger vision for a "Superchain" ecosystem, an interconnected network of many Layer-2 blockchains that can communicate with each other.\
The ultimate goal for World is ambitious, to build a network that serves over a billion people. To achieve this, the platform is designed to support applications with real-world utility, focusing on areas like stablecoin-based finance, international remittances, and commerce. The integration with World ID's proof of personhood is central to this vision, as it aims to create a system where developers can build applications for a network of verified humans, reducing the risks of fraud and spam that are common in the digital world. Anyone with a compatible digital wallet can start exploring and using these applications, with the project’s own World App serving as the primary gateway.World's launch of Priority Blockspace for Humans is a genuinely novel experiment in the ongoing effort to make blockchain technology more equitable and accessible. The project addresses a real and frustrating problem for everyday users who are often outmaneuvered and outspent by bots. By creating a system where human identity, not economic power, dictates network priority, World is making a bold statement about the kind of digital future it wants to build. The focus on a fairer system is a commendable goal that could, if successful, set a new standard for how public blockchains operate.\
However, the project is not without its controversies, primarily centered around the privacy implications of its iris-scanning World ID system. While the Worldcoin Foundation maintains that the biometric data is handled securely and used only to generate a unique, anonymous verification, concerns about the centralization of such sensitive personal data persist. The success of World Chain is therefore intrinsically linked to its ability to earn and maintain public trust, not just in its technology but also in its stewardship of user data. The decision to make its core technology open-source and subject it to independent audits is a positive step in this direction.\
Ultimately, World is forcing a necessary conversation about who our digital infrastructure should serve. Is it for the highest bidder, or is it for the individual human user? While the road to a billion users is long and fraught with challenges, the launch of World Chain and its human-first priority system is a significant and fascinating step. It's an attempt to technically enforce a more level playing field, and the entire technology world will be watching to see if this radical idea can deliver on its promise of a fairer internet for all.Don’t forget to like and share the story! ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Can the US and Iran reach a new nuclear deal? #politics #shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/eU_rtVRoOQg</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/eU_rtVRoOQg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 15:26:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[What could it take to negotiate a new nuclear deal with Iran?

They claimed that trans women don’t meet the legal definition of women under Indian law because they cannot get pregnant and said Shabana’s allegations of harassment lacked evidence.However, the judge said that articles 14, 15 and 21 of the constitution, which guarantee a variety of discrimination protections, including the right to life and personal liberty, meant trans women’s rights to be recognised as women superseded the law.“A trans woman, born male and later transitioning to female, is legally entitled to recognition as a woman,” he wrote in his ruling. “Denying such protection by questioning their womanhood amounts to discrimination.”Trans activist and artist Kalki Subramaniam told the Washington Blade that she was relieved and delighted to see the court “upholding our basic human right to be identified as what we want.” She went on to say: “For [the] transgender community, especially trans women, this verdict means a lot.”The Indian government has been under mounting pressure to modernise its laws and policies on LGBTQ+ rights. Same-sex marriage is still illegal, despite growing support for its legalisation.Prime minister Narendra Modi’s government have previously labelled same-sex marriage an “elitist” viewpoint that “seriously affects the interests of every citizen”.An affidavit establishing the government’s views on same-sex unions, in 2023, proclaimed that marriage was valid only between “biological males and females [and that] this definition [was] socially, culturally and legally ingrained into the very idea and concept of marriage and ought not to be disturbed or diluted by judicial interpretation”.Let us know in the comments below, and remember to keep the conversation respectful.  ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Uma Thurman calls return to sword fighting a leap of faith</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/FTd-4n45JbU</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/FTd-4n45JbU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 15:09:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Uma Thurman jumped back into sword fighting for “The Old Guard 2,” alongside Charlize Theron.

The campaign began on May 27 and has already seen participation from tens of thousands of users across its first two rounds.Developed by Korean blockchain security company IoTrust, D’CENT is widely recognized as a pioneer in the hardware wallet space. It introduced biometric authentication to the market in 2018 and has since expanded its global user base to more than 200 countries. The wallet supports more than 85 blockchain networks and 4,500 tokens. Now, D’CENT is evolving beyond secure storage, aiming to become a full-featured and intuitive Web3 platform that integrates portfolio tools, ecosystem discovery, and reward-based participation.To support this shift,  launched Tap That Drop — the first seasonal quest campaign of its kind embedded in a wallet. Over several months, twelve blockchain projects will each run a two-week campaign featuring interactive quests, project-specific NFTs, and token-based rewards. Users who collect all twelve NFTs will qualify for a Mega Airdrop after season 1 ends. The 2024 edition received strong engagement from the Web3 community, with many participants highlighting the value of the rewards.The campaign has also served as a way for participating projects to introduce their ecosystems to new users and drive deeper interaction.The format has already proven effective. The first round with Skate attracted more than 20,000 participants, with rewards fully claimed within few hours of launch. The second round with MAP Protocol saw even faster response, with all rewards claimed in less than two hours. Across both campaigns, biometric hardware wallet users received higher-tier rewards, and completing a quest unlocked access to wallet discounts — creating additional value for both new and existing users.The third partner in the campaign is Taiko, an Ethereum-equivalent Layer 2 rollup focused on scalability without compromising decentralization. The protocol uses based sequencing for community-centric block production. Since its mainnet launch, where Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin proposed the first block, Taiko has been listed on Binance Alpha as one of the platform’s top ten traded tokens and has kicked off Trailblazers Season 5 with 10,000 TAIKO in liquidity rewards.“We believe wallets are no longer just for holding crypto. They’re evolving into platforms for exploration and rewards,” said Sangsu Baek, CEO of IoTrust. “Through Tap That Drop and upcoming features like real-time portfolio tools, we’re building a new kind of user experience, where security and participation go hand in hand. That’s what sets D’CENT apart from other wallets in the space.”The Taiko campaign within Tap That Drop begins on June 25 in the D’CENT app. Participants can complete quests, mint a Taiko-themed NFT from the Star Collection, and claim token-based rewards. Hardware wallet users will continue to receive higher reward tiers and access to exclusive discounts.👉 Download D’CENT App and join the quest:  isn’t just a wallet—it’s where security meets opportunity.Developed by IoTrust, D’CENT is the world’s first biometric hardware wallet, built with SE (Secure Element) & TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) technology to ensure bank-grade security for your digital assets.But D’CENT goes beyond security. Unlike traditional wallets that simply store crypto, D’CENT empowers users to do more—unlocking rewards, accessing exclusive benefits, and seamlessly interacting with Web3 services. As the only wallet offering both hardware and software solutions, D’CENT provides the flexibility to secure, earn, and engage, all in one place.:::tip

For years, the promise of DeFi, a parallel financial system built on blockchain technology, has been available to a select few who could navigate its steep learning curve. Now, an emerging web3 startup edwin has publicly launched an AI terminal, a move that signals a potential shift in how people interact with this emerging financial landscape. The release aims to transform complex financial transactions into simple conversations, potentially opening the doors of DeFi to a much broader audience.The traditional gateway to DeFi has been the crypto wallet. While essential for holding assets, these wallets often present users with a daunting array of options for swapping tokens or earning yield, with interfaces that can be unintuitive for newcomers. This complexity has created a significant barrier to entry. AI is now being introduced as a new layer to simplify this experience. By integrating artificial intelligence, the goal is to translate human language into machine-executable commands on the blockchain. The edwin terminal is designed to be this bridge, giving users a conversational way to manage their investments through intelligent agents.A New Gateway for the Next Wave of UsersThe edwin AI terminal provides a user interface that connects to various DeFi applications through a chat window. After a user connects their existing web wallet, they can begin typing commands in natural language to a smart AI agent. This agent then interprets these commands to access a wide range of on-chain protocols for trading, lending, or generating yield. The process is designed to remove the multiple, often confusing steps typically required to perform such actions, replacing them with a single instruction.This approach is tailored for both beginner and intermediate users who understand the basic premise of DeFi but are often deterred by the intricate user experience. A key aspect of the design is that users retain full control over their digital assets. The AI agent acts as an intermediary that can only execute actions based on direct and explicit user commands. This is a crucial distinction in an industry where security and ownership are paramount. This model is often referred to as "non-custodial," meaning the user, and only the user, holds the cryptographic keys to their funds. edwin does not take possession of user assets at any point.Liran Markin, the Chief Executive Officer of edwin, articulated the vision behind the launch. "We believe that DeFi should be as easy as chatting," Markin stated. "The new edwin terminal is our way of making onchain finance finally accessible to the average user. It’s secure, powerful, and highly intuitive." This sentiment points to a broader industry challenge. Research indicates that a significant number of new users, approximately 65 percent, abandon decentralized applications after their first interaction. This high rate of disengagement is largely attributed to poor onboarding experiences and confusing interfaces, which has stalled mainstream adoption of DeFi.The Technology Behind the ConversationTo function, the terminal's AI agent utilizes a combination of technologies. It integrates LangChain, a framework for developing applications powered by language models, and Anthropic, an AI safety and research company. These are coupled with edwin’s proprietary MCP tooling, which is specifically designed for executing DeFi transactions. This technological stack allows the AI to understand user requests and interact with a curated list of established DeFi services. It aggregates fundamental financial activities like trading, lending, and yield farming into one unified interface.Gal Wiernik, the Chief Technology Officer at edwin, explained the technical goal. "We’ve built this terminal for the next wave of crypto users," Wiernik said. "It combines wallet security, AI reasoning, and real DeFi tools, all from your browser." The intention is to abstract away the complexity without sacrificing functionality. Instead of needing to visit multiple websites, understand different user interfaces, and manually connect a wallet to each one, a user could theoretically ask the edwin agent to find the best yield for a specific asset, and the agent would then present and execute the optimal strategy upon approval.The core value proposition is the simplification of a fragmented and often intimidating ecosystem. By creating a single point of interaction that speaks a user's language, the terminal aims to empower individuals to explore financial opportunities across different blockchains, a concept known as omnichain, with greater clarity. The AI is not just a chatbot, but an execution tool that leverages large language models to reason and act on financial instructions within the secure environment of the user's own wallet.The launch of the edwin AI terminal represents a logical and perhaps necessary evolution in the DeFi space. The technology's core promise has always been one of democratization, yet its practical application has been anything but democratic. The user experience has been the single greatest impediment to widespread adoption. While early adopters were willing to tolerate clunky interfaces and a high degree of technical knowledge, the next hundred million users will not.Edwin's approach of using a conversational AI interface is a compelling solution. It leans into a user behavior that is already universal: chatting. If the execution is as seamless as the concept, it could significantly lower the barrier to entry. The non-custodial design is critical; without it, the product would be a non-starter for the security-conscious crypto community. The true test will be in the AI's reliability and the breadth of its integrations. Can it truly understand the nuances of a user's intent and execute transactions flawlessly and optimally across a wide range of protocols? The potential for error, misunderstanding, or exploitation in an AI-mediated financial transaction must be infinitesimally small.Ultimately, the success of edwin and similar platforms will depend on building trust. Users must trust not only the security of the underlying code but also the reasoning capabilities of the AI. The company's challenge will be to prove its robustness and safety over time. If it succeeds, the concept of a DeFi "agent" could become the standard, moving the industry away from manual clicks and toward goal-oriented instructions. This is a meaningful step toward fulfilling DeFi's original mission of creating a more open and accessible financial system.

Having a tutor can be awesome, but there are downsides: they can be expensive (since you pay by the hour), difficult to schedule, and have a high upfront cost (finding a tutor you like often forces you to cycle through a few that you don’t).We wanted something that would talk with us — realistically, in full conversations — and actually help us improve. So we built it ourselves.
The app relies on a custom voice AI pipeline combining STT (speech-to-text), TTS (text-to-speech), LLMs, long term memory, interruptions, turn-taking, etc. Getting speech-to-text to work well for learners was one of the hardest parts — especially with accents, multi-lingual sentences, and noisy environments. We now combine Gemini Flash, Whisper, Scribe, and GPT-4o-transcribe to minimize errors and keep the conversation flowing.We didn’t want to focus too much on gamification. In our experience, that leads to users performing well in the app, achieving long streaks and so on, without actually getting fluent in the language you're wanting to learn.With ISSEN you instantly speak and immerse yourself in the language, which, while not easy, is a much more efficient way to learn.We combine this with a word bank and SRS flashcards for new words learned in the AI voice chats, which allows very rapid improvement in both vocabulary and speaking skills. We also create custom curriculums for each student based on goals, interests, and preferences, and fully customizable settings like speed, turn taking, formality, etc.App: https://issen.com (works on web, iOS, Android)
Pricing: 20 min free trial, $20–29/month (depending on duration and specific geography)We’d love your feedback — on the tech, the UX, or what you’d wish from a tool like this. Thanks!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hegseth berates the media for &apos;hunting for scandals&apos; as Pentagon defends Trump on Iran strikes</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJsqopnIZ7g</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/CJsqopnIZ7g?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 14:30:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth doubles down on how destructive U.S. attacks had been on Iran's nuclear facilities.

The Khronos® Vulkan Working Group has been steadily working to make Vulkan a joy to use, and simplifying the synchronization model has been high on our priority list. One of the most frequent developer frustrations has been the complexity of managing image layouts, a pain point we’re tackling head-on with the new VK_KHR_unified_image_layouts extension, which aims to eliminate the need for most layout transitions entirely.It’s been over a decade since Vulkan’s synchronization model was first designed. At the time, the graphics development community strongly favored explicit control over synchronization, and the Vulkan Working Group responded with an API that prioritized performance on the hardware of that era, delivering maximum flexibility and control to application developers.In hindsight—and perhaps unsurprisingly—synchronization has turned out to be one of Vulkan’s most challenging aspects, tripping up both new and seasoned developers. The synchronization model is complex enough that many applications struggle to issue synchronization commands that are efficient or even correct. The  extension introduced several incremental improvements while largely preserving the foundational principles of Vulkan 1.0’s original approach.Since then, modern GPUs have evolved significantly, including how they handle synchronization, making many of Vulkan’s original design constraints increasingly outdated. Recognizing this, the Vulkan Working Group is now actively working to streamline synchronization, aiming to improve usability and make high-performance graphics development more accessible. The newly released VK_KHR_unified_image_layouts extension is a major milestone on that path.Vulkan 1.0 introduced several image layouts, with later extensions adding a few more. In practice, though, these layouts typically map to just a handful of actual physical layouts or compression formats. One notable exception is VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED, which isn’t a physical layout at all but instead serves to initialize internal metadata for newly created images.Image layout transitions in Vulkan exist primarily for three reasons: – Transitions from VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED serve as image initialization operations. – When transferring ownership to or from external queue families or presenting images to the display, transitions may be required to ensure compatibility with external components that don’t support Vulkan’s internal compression schemes. – Even within the same Vulkan device, some subsystems may not understand the framebuffer compression used by others. For instance, using depth/stencil or multisampled color attachments outside of a render pass may require decompression on certain hardware.With VK_KHR_unified_image_layouts, the Vulkan Working Group recognizes that the third case— internal incompatibility—is no longer relevant for most modern GPUs. This extension allows developers to bypass the majority of layout transitions, significantly simplifying synchronization and reducing boilerplate. Better yet, nearly all GPU vendors are ready to support this extension on current-generation hardware. It’s already on the Vulkan roadmap, with the goal of including it in the core API.At its heart, VK_KHR_unified_image_layouts is a simple but powerful from the driver to the application: it guarantees that  can be used efficiently in nearly all cases. Aside from a few specific scenarios, such as image initialization or presentation, developers no longer need to use layout transitions at all, just use!Validation layer support is expected in the July Vulkan SDK. As always—and especially with this extension—we strongly recommend enabling Synchronization Validation in the Vulkan validation layers. Several common synchronization errors are caught by mismatched image layouts, but standard validation will no longer be able to detect these if the layout is set to . Vulkan’s core principles—explicit control and low-level access to modern GPU features—aren’t going anywhere. But the Vulkan Working Group is placing greater emphasis on developer experience. Instead of just building new features, we’re revisiting older ones to make them easier to use. VK_KHR_unified_image_layouts is the latest example, and more improvements are on the way.We’re excited about a future where synchronization is no longer a source of frustration. But we can’t get there without your valuable feedback. Join the conversation on the Vulkan Discord, or leave a comment below. Let us know how this extension is working for you, what challenges you’re facing, and which pain points you’d like us to tackle next!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>People use AI for companionship much less than we’re led to believe</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/26/people-use-ai-for-companionship-much-less-than-were-led-to-believe/</link><author>Ram Iyer</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 14:21:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A report by Anthropic reveals that people rarely seek companionship from AI, and turn to AI for emotional support or advice only 2.9% of the time. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google DeepMind Releases AlphaGenome</title><link>https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphagenome-ai-for-better-understanding-the-genome/</link><author>i_love_limes</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 14:16:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Introducing a new, unifying DNA sequence model that advances regulatory variant-effect prediction and promises to shed new light on genome function — now available via API.The genome is our cellular instruction manual. It’s the complete set of DNA which guides nearly every part of a living organism, from appearance and function to growth and reproduction. Small variations in a genome’s DNA sequence can alter an organism’s response to its environment or its susceptibility to disease. But deciphering how the genome’s instructions are read at the molecular level — and what happens when a small DNA variation occurs — is still one of biology’s greatest mysteries.Today, we introduce AlphaGenome, a new artificial intelligence (AI) tool that more comprehensively and accurately predicts how single variants or mutations in human DNA sequences impact a wide range of biological processes regulating genes. This was enabled, among other factors, by technical advances allowing the model to process long DNA sequences and output high-resolution predictions.To advance scientific research, we’re making AlphaGenome available in preview via our AlphaGenome API for non-commercial research, and planning to release the model in the future.We believe AlphaGenome can be a valuable resource for the scientific community, helping scientists better understand genome function, disease biology, and ultimately, drive new biological discoveries and the development of new treatments.Our AlphaGenome model takes a long DNA sequence as input — up to 1 million letters, also known as base-pairs — and predicts thousands of molecular properties characterising its regulatory activity. It can also score the effects of genetic variants or mutations by comparing predictions of mutated sequences with unmutated ones.Predicted properties include where genes start and where they end in different cell types and tissues, where they get spliced, the amount of RNA being produced, and also which DNA bases are accessible, close to one another, or bound by certain proteins. Training data was sourced from large public consortia including ENCODE, GTEx, 4D Nucleome and FANTOM5, which experimentally measured these properties covering important modalities of gene regulation across hundreds of human and mouse cell types and tissues.The AlphaGenome architecture uses convolutional layers to initially detect short patterns in the genome sequence, transformers to communicate information across all positions in the sequence, and a final series of layers to turn the detected patterns into predictions for different modalities. During training, this computation is distributed across multiple interconnected Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) for a single sequence.This model builds on our previous genomics model, Enformer and is complementary to AlphaMissense, which specializes in categorizing the effects of variants within protein-coding regions. These regions cover 2% of the genome. The remaining 98%, called non-coding regions, are crucial for orchestrating gene activity and contain many variants linked to diseases. AlphaGenome offers a new perspective for interpreting these expansive sequences and the variants within them.AlphaGenome’s distinctive featuresAlphaGenome offers several distinctive features compared to existing DNA sequence models:Long sequence-context at high resolutionOur model analyzes up to 1 million DNA letters and makes predictions at the resolution of individual letters. Long sequence context is important for covering regions regulating genes from far away and base-resolution is important for capturing fine-grained biological details.Previous models had to trade off sequence length and resolution, which limited the range of modalities they could jointly model and accurately predict. Our technical advances address this limitation without significantly increasing the training resources — training a single AlphaGenome model (without distillation) took four hours and required half of the compute budget used to train our original Enformer model.Comprehensive multimodal predictionBy unlocking high resolution prediction for long input sequences, AlphaGenome can predict the most diverse range of modalities. In doing so, AlphaGenome provides scientists with more comprehensive information about the complex steps of gene regulation.Efficient variant scoringIn addition to predicting a diverse range of molecular properties, AlphaGenome can efficiently score the impact of a genetic variant on all of these properties in a second. It does this by contrasting predictions of mutated sequences with unmutated ones, and efficiently summarising that contrast using different approaches for different modalities.Novel splice-junction modelingMany rare genetic diseases, such as spinal muscular atrophy and some forms of cystic fibrosis, can be caused by errors in RNA splicing — a process where parts of the RNA molecule are removed, or “spliced out”, and the remaining ends rejoined. For the first time, AlphaGenome can explicitly model the location and expression level of these junctions directly from sequence, offering deeper insights about the consequences of genetic variants on RNA splicing.State-of-the-art performance across benchmarksAlphaGenome achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of genomic prediction benchmarks, such as predicting which parts of the DNA molecule will be in close proximity, whether a genetic variant will increase or decrease expression of a gene, or whether it will change the gene’s splicing pattern.When producing predictions for single DNA sequences, AlphaGenome outperformed the best external models on 22 out of 24 evaluations. And when predicting the regulatory effect of a variant, it matched or exceeded the top-performing external models on 24 out of 26 evaluations.This comparison included models specialized for individual tasks. AlphaGenome was the only model that could jointly predict all of the assessed modalities, highlighting its generality. Read more in our preprint.The benefits of a unifying modelAlphaGenome’s generality allows scientists to simultaneously explore a variant's impact on a number of modalities with a single API call. This means that scientists can generate and test hypotheses more rapidly, without having to use multiple models to investigate different modalities.Moreover AlphaGenome’s strong performance indicates it has learned a relatively general representation of DNA sequence in the context of gene regulation. This makes it a strong foundation for the wider community to build upon. Once the model is fully released, scientists will be able to adapt and fine-tune it on their own datasets to better tackle their unique research questions.Finally, this approach provides a flexible and scalable architecture for the future. By extending the training data, AlphaGenome’s capabilities could be extended to yield better performance, cover more species, or include additional modalities to make the model even more comprehensive.It’s a milestone for the field. For the first time, we have a single model that unifies long-range context, base-level precision and state-of-the-art performance across a whole spectrum of genomic tasks.Dr. Caleb Lareau, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer CenterAlphaGenome's predictive capabilities could help several research avenues: By more accurately predicting genetic disruptions, AlphaGenome could help researchers pinpoint the potential causes of disease more precisely, and better interpret the functional impact of variants linked to certain traits, potentially uncovering new therapeutic targets. We think the model is especially suitable for studying rare variants with potentially large effects, such as those causing rare Mendelian disorders. Its predictions could be used to guide the design of synthetic DNA with specific regulatory function — for example, only activating a gene in nerve cells but not muscle cells. It could accelerate our understanding of the genome by assisting in mapping its crucial functional elements and defining their roles, identifying the most essential DNA instructions for regulating a specific cell type's function.For example, we used AlphaGenome to investigate the potential mechanism of a cancer-associated mutation. In an existing study of patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), researchers observed mutations at particular locations in the genome. Using AlphaGenome, we predicted that the mutations would activate a nearby gene called TAL1 by introducing a MYB DNA binding motif, which replicated the known disease mechanism and highlighted AlphaGenome’s ability to link specific non-coding variants to disease genes.AlphaGenome will be a powerful tool for the field. Determining the relevance of different non-coding variants can be extremely challenging, particularly to do at scale. This tool will provide a crucial piece of the puzzle, allowing us to make better connections to understand diseases like cancer.Professor Marc Mansour, University College LondonAlphaGenome marks a significant step forward, but it's important to acknowledge its current limitations.Like other sequence-based models, accurately capturing the influence of very distant regulatory elements, like those over 100,000 DNA letters away, is still an ongoing challenge. Another priority for future work is further increasing the model’s ability to capture cell- and tissue-specific patterns.We haven't designed or validated AlphaGenome for personal genome prediction, a known challenge for AI models. Instead, we focused more on characterising the performance on individual genetic variants. And while AlphaGenome can predict molecular outcomes, it doesn't give the full picture of how genetic variations lead to complex traits or diseases. These often involve broader biological processes, like developmental and environmental factors, that are beyond the direct scope of our model.We’re continuing to improve our models and gathering feedback to help us address these gaps.Enabling the community to unlock AlphaGenome's potentialAlphaGenome is now available for non-commercial use via our AlphaGenome API. Please note that our model’s predictions are intended only for research use and haven’t been designed or validated for direct clinical purposes.Researchers worldwide are invited to get in touch with potential use-cases for AlphaGenome and to ask questions or share feedback through the community forum.We hope AlphaGenome will be an important tool for better understanding the genome and we’re committed to working alongside external experts across academia, industry, and government organizations to ensure AlphaGenome benefits as many people as possible.Together with the collective efforts of the wider scientific community, we hope it will deepen our understanding of the complex cellular processes encoded in the DNA sequence and the effects of variants, and drive exciting new discoveries in genomics and healthcare.We would like to thank Juanita Bawagan, Arielle Bier, Stephanie Booth, Irina Andronic, Armin Senoner, Dhavanthi Hariharan, Rob Ashley, Agata Laydon and Kathryn Tunyasuvunakool for their help with the text and figures.This work was done thanks to the contributions of the AlphaGenome co-authors: Žiga Avsec, Natasha Latysheva, Jun Cheng, Guido Novati, Kyle R.

While some may be surprised by this fact, Linux enthusiasts have every reason to be happy about the continued success and influence of Linux in the mobile world.Read on for the latest stats, updated links and proof that Linux is still at the heart of the smartphone ecosystem. This is a follow-up to my previous articles in 2013 and 2021.Google formalized their efforts to keep Android closer to upstream Linux by introducing the Generic Kernel Image (GKI) project in 2019. Since then, the GKI project has matured a lot, with ongoing upstream kernel development focused on reducing fragmentation, upstreaming Android-specific features and establishing a stable Kernel Module Interface (KMI).All of which has strengthened Android’s connection to the mainline Linux kernel and fostered closer collaboration between Google, device vendors, and the Linux community.Android and Chrome OS: Still Linux at the CoreGoogle’s Android and Chrome OS are operating systems originally based on the Linux kernel. Android, in particular, has continued to evolve, now running on long-term support (LTS) Linux kernels, such as versions 4.19, 5.4, and more recently, 6.x series, with regular merges from the Linux mainline into the Android-common kernel tree.2025 Smartphone Market Share: Linux Still LeadsRecent Canalys (Omdia) research shows that in Q1 2025, the global smartphone market shipped 296.9 million units, with Android-based devices continuing to dominate. Samsung led with 60.5 million units (20% market share), followed by Apple with 55.0 million units (19%). Xiaomi, vivo, and OPPO rounded out the top five.Combining Android, Xiaomi, Vivo, OPPO, and other Android-based OSes,Linux powers around 80% of the global smartphone market.Android’s share remains robust, with estimates consistently placing it at over 80% of global smartphone shipments. Yup, more than a decade after my first article on this, the vast majority of smartphones in use today are still powered by the Linux kernel.Alternative Linux Smartphones in 2025While Android dominates, several alternative Linux-based smartphones continue to attract enthusiasts and privacy-focused users: Purism’s security- and privacy-focused smartphone, running on Debian Linux, continues to receive updates and improvements. It remains a leading choice for those who value open-source hardware and software. Pine64’s PinePhone and PinePhone Pro offer mainline Linux support and hardware kill switches, appealing to developers and tinkerers. The Pro¹-X, an updated version of the original Pro1, features a physical keyboard and support for multiple Linux-based OS options, including LineageOS and Ubuntu Touch. KDE’s Plasma Mobile continues to evolve, supporting a range of devices including the PinePhone and select Android handsets via postmarketOS.Checking the Linux Kernel Version on Your AndroidTo see which Linux kernel your Android device is running, open  and tap on  or . For rooted devices, you can use Termux and run:This command will display your device’s kernel version and build information.Conclusion: Linux’s Enduring DominanceAndroid’s open-source nature and the flexibility of the Linux kernel continue to drive innovation and user empowerment in the smartphone market. With Android holding steady at around 80% global market share in 2025, Linux’s influence is as strong as ever.Smartphones powered by Linux continue to dominate the global smartphone market in 2025. While some may still be surprised by this fact, Linux enthusiasts have every reason to celebrate the ongoing success and influence of Linux in the mobile world.With the fall of the Windows phone, almost 100% of all smartphones are powered by Unix and Unix-like systems. Meanwhile, alternative Linux and Android-based smartphones such as those listed above, offer exciting options for those seeking greater privacy, control, or experimentation.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Unboxing a Gravastar Mercury V75 Pro keyboard!</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9NCjFf0ysc</link><author>Chyrosran22</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/M9NCjFf0ysc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 13:00:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD0y51PJfvkZNe3y3FR5riw">Chyrosran22</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Get it here: https://www.gravastar.com/collections/hall-effect-keyboard?utm_source=yt&utm_medium=kol&utm_campaign=Chyrosran22

William Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie and Freddie, ordered the agencies Wednesday to prepare a proposal for consideration of crypto as an asset for reserves when they assess risks in single-family home loans.
 
Pulte also instructed the agencies that their mortgage risk assessments should not require cryptocurrency assets to be converted to U.S. dollars. And only crypto assets that "can be evidenced and stored on a U.S.-regulated centralized exchange subject to all applicable laws" are to be considered by the agencies in their proposal, Pulte wrote in a written order, effective immediately. Pulte was sworn in as the head of FHFA in March. Public records show that as of January 2025, Pulte's spouse owned between $500,000 and $1 million of bitcoin and a similar amount of Solana's SOL token. [...]
 
The policy change is meant to encourage banks to expand how they gauge borrowers' creditworthiness, in hopes that more aspiring homebuyers can qualify for a home loan. It also recognizes that cryptocurrencies have grown in popularity as an alternative to traditional investments, such as bonds and stocks. The agencies have to come up with their proposals "as soon as reasonably practical," according to the order. "This is a big win for advocates of cryptocurrencies who want crypto to be treated the same way as other assets are," said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin.
 
Currently, stock investments are treated as qualifying assets that count toward reserves that banks want borrowers to have. But assets that are more volatile, like individual stocks or crypto, may be discounted by lenders, Fairweather noted. "As long as lenders are appropriately discounting crypto based on volatility, it's fine that crypto investments count toward reserves," she said.
 
Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, added: "If Fannie and Freddie are going to accept cryptocurrency as collateral, that's a strong incentive for banks to shift their practices. Because people who might otherwise have to sell cryptocurrency to qualify -- and maybe that's a deal-breaker for them now -- under this new policy, they can qualify. It sort of expands the potential pool of eligible buyers."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Learnings from building AI agents</title><link>https://www.cubic.dev/blog/learnings-from-building-ai-agents</link><author>pomarie</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 12:45:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I’m Paul, cofounder of cubic—an "AI-native GitHub." One of our core features is an AI code review agent that performs an initial review pass, catching bugs, anti-patterns, duplicated code, and similar issues in pull requests.When we first released this agent back in April, the main feedback we got was straightforward: it was too noisy.Even small PRs often ended up flooded with multiple low-value comments, nitpicks, or outright false positives. Rather than helping reviewers, it cluttered discussions and obscured genuinely valuable feedback.We decided to take a step back and thoroughly investigate why this was happening.After three major architecture revisions and extensive offline testing, we managed to reduce false positives by  without sacrificing recall.Many of these lessons turned out to be broadly useful—not just for code review agents but for designing effective AI systems in general.1. The Face‑Palm Phase: A Single, Do‑Everything AgentOur initial architecture was straightforward but problematic:
↓

↓
It looked clean in theory but quickly fell apart in practice:Excessive false positives: The agent often mistook style issues for critical bugs, flagged resolved issues, and repeated suggestions our linters had already addressed.Users lost trust: Developers quickly learned to ignore the comments altogether. When half the comments feel irrelevant, the truly important ones get missed.Opaque reasoning: Understanding why the agent made specific calls was practically impossible. Even explicit prompts like "ignore minor style issues" had minimal effect.We tried standard solutions—longer prompts, adjusting the model's temperature, experimenting with sampling—but saw little meaningful improvement.After extensive trial-and-error, we developed an architecture that significantly improved results and proved effective in real-world repositories. These solutions underpin the 51% reduction in false positives currently running in production.2.1 Explicit Reasoning LogsWe required the AI to explicitly state its reasoning before providing any feedback:This approach provided critical benefits:Enabled us to clearly trace the AI’s decision-making process. If reasoning was flawed, we could quickly identify and exclude the pattern in future iterations.Encouraged structured thinking by forcing the AI to justify its findings first, significantly reducing arbitrary conclusions.Created a foundation to diagnose and resolve root causes behind other issues we faced.Initially, the agent had extensive tooling—Language Server Protocol (LSP), static analysis, test runners, and more. However, explicit reasoning logs revealed most analyses relied on a few core tools, with extra complexity causing confusion and mistakes.We streamlined the toolkit to essential components only—a simplified LSP and a basic terminal.With fewer distractions, the agent spent more energy confirming genuine issues, significantly improving precision.2.3 Specialized Micro-Agents Over Generalized RulesInitially, our instinct was to continuously add more rules into a single large prompt to handle edge cases:“Ignore unused variables in .test.ts files.”“Skip import checks in Python’s .py.”“Don't lint markdown files.”This rapidly became unsustainable and was largely ineffective as the AI frequently overlooked many rules.Our breakthrough came from employing specialized micro-agents, each handling a narrowly-defined scope:: Quickly assesses changes and identifies necessary checks.: Detects vulnerabilities such as injection or insecure authentication.: Flags repeated or copied code.: Handles typos and documentation consistency.Specializing allowed each agent to maintain a focused context, keeping token usage efficient and precision high. The main trade-off was increased token consumption due to overlapping context, managed through effective caching strategies.These architecture and prompt improvements led to meaningful results across hundreds of real pull requests from active open-source and private repositories. Specifically, over the past six weeks:51% fewer false positives, directly increasing developer trust and usability.Median comments per pull request cut by half, helping teams concentrate on genuinely important issues.Teams reported notably smoother review processes, spending less time managing irrelevant comments and more time effectively merging changes.Additionally, the reduced noise significantly improved developer confidence and engagement, making reviews faster and more impactful.Explicit reasoning improves clarity. Require your AI to clearly explain its rationale first—this boosts accuracy and simplifies debugging.Simplify the toolset. Regularly evaluate your agent's toolkit and remove tools rarely used (less than 10% of tasks).Specialize with micro-agents. Keep each AI agent tightly focused on a single task, reducing cognitive overload and enhancing precision.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Firefox 141 Beta Lowering RAM Use On Linux But Still Benchmarking Behind Chrome</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/review/firefox-141-linux-ram</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 12:41:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Following this week's release of Firefox 140, Firefox 141 was promoted to beta.

Dynamic analysis help in observing actual runtime behaviors and activities for a package, installed in a sandbox environment. It complements our Static Analysis system and helps:To verify and correlate static analysis findings with actual runtime behaviorTo overcome the limitations of static analysis which may have false positives and negativesTo observe how packages actually behave when executed in a controlled environmentTo identify malicious packages that might evade static code analysisTo reduce the need for human intervention (manual analysis) over timeThe goal of this blog is to share our learnings and approach for identifying malicious packages based on dynamic analysis signals. This is a step towards having a sound and reliable baseline for package installation analysis so that it can be used to identify outliers and anomalies.We tracked nearly  events generated from our Dynamic Analysis System, analyzing more than  packages since we started operating this infrastructure. As events are generated, we needed a way to find  activities and potential malicious packages that can be subjected to manual review. This can only be found using heuristics and patterns, not manual review of all events generated by all packages.As a first step, we decided to aggregate following information from the events:Network Connection, IP AggregatorBinary execution on installThe rationale for these metrics are:Irrespective of specific TTP,  payload will eventually be executed by a malicious packageThe payload will either make a network call or execute a command (eg. ) in an unusual wayThis hypothesis can be substantiated by our past observations where we observed multiple malicious packages eventually downloads a 2nd-stage payload from a remote C2 server or uploads data to a remote server (exfiltration).Any package installation process always triggers network connections, especially to the source registries such as , ,  etc. We cannot only detect network connections, we have to identify  in the distribution of these connections. To identify outliers, we log every  for these connections and analyze the distribution of these . The following chart shows the distribution of  for network connections:Looking at the data, we can spot some interesting patterns. A few IP addresses are  in the distribution. From a security perspective, these rare connections raise red flags since legitimate package installations typically connect to well known, frequently accessed endpoints. The chart below highlights some of these suspicious one-off connections that may be suitable candidates for further investigation:For example, looking up IP  on VirusTotal shows it has been classified as malicious by multiple security vendors.Next, we performed  to identify the hostnames of these IP addresses. Below are some of the IP addresses that were resolved to a hostname.Looking at the hostnames, domains like , , , and mail.sms-system-alert.com are known malicious domains. In particular,  (Out-of-band Application Security Testing) domains are commonly used for malicious purposes like data exfiltration and command & control. We have seen this in our previous post Burp Collaborator used in Malicious npm Packages.Abnormal Binary ExecutionPackages introducing pre-compiled binaries during installation is a common observation. For example, top binaries shipped with  and  packages or expected to be present in the system are , , , , ,  and more. They are executed for legitimate purposes, but can be used to harm the system as soon as the package is installed. The following chart shows the distribution of these binaries:Looking at the distribution, we can spot suspicious binaries like , , and  that appear infrequently. These unknown executables pose potential security risks, as they can execute malicious code immediately upon package installation, potentially compromising the system before any security controls can detect and prevent the threat.While the system is at an early research stage, we present a case study of a real malicious package that was identified using the approach described above. This package is eslint-config-airbnb-compat and was not detected as malicious by our static analysis system. Following are the high level chain of events that led to the identification of this package:Suspicious IP address  was detected in the network connection logs.Events were correlated with the package eslint-config-airbnb-compat for which our static analysis report was blindManual analysis did not conclusively identify root cause of this network activityDependency graph analysis identified  as a transitive dependency with stage-2 loader codeManual analysis tied the two packages together and confirmed the malicious intentFor this analysis, the trigger was a low key IP address  that appeared in the network connection logs. The reverse DNS lookup revealed the hostname mail.sms-system-alert.com that was flagged as malicious by VirusTotal. This gave us enough confidence to investigate the package further.We backtrack the package which is associated with this event, making connection to this  IP (who’s host was mail.sms-system-alert.com), and found eslint-config-airbnb-compat. This package appears to impersonate legitimate eslint-config-airbnb possibly with the goal of starjacking and spoofing its origin to automated security tools.We found, eslint-config-airbnb-compat contains a post install script declared in  to execute . This is not totally unusual for a large number of  packages, although it does raise security concerns.However, manual analysis revealed multiple unusual behavior. Likely to avoid identification, the  does not have any malicious code. It simply does the following:Copy the embedded  to The  file contains the following The host  resolves to our target IP address Execute  if  directory is not presentAt this point, we were fairly confident that this package is malicious. However, we needed to identify the root cause of this malicious behavior. We started by analyzing the dependency graph of this package and found  as a transitive dependency with stage-2 loader code. The package  in turn has a post install script:The  in  contains interesting code:When introduced through eslint-config-airbnb-compat, it will have proxy=https://proxy.eslint-proxy.site in the  call above. The above fetch call is expected to fail to trigger  function with  provided error message.The remote server at https://proxy.eslint-proxy.site can return a  message such as {"error": "<JS Payload>"} which in turn will be passed to  as an Error object.The error handler in turn does the following:Decode the message as  stringConstructs a function from the decoded stringFinally executes the remote codeThis pretty much confirm the malicious behavior of the entire attack chain. It implements a multi-stage remote code execution attack using a transitive dependency to hide the malicious code.Dynamic analysis provides a complementary approach for detecting malicious open source packages that might evade static analysis. By monitoring network connections and binary executions during package installation, we can identify suspicious behaviors that indicate potential threats. The multi-stage attack discovered in the eslint-config-airbnb-compat package demonstrates how sophisticated these attacks can be, using transitive dependencies and obfuscation techniques to hide malicious code.As attackers continue to develop increasingly complex methods to compromise the open source software supply chains, combining static and dynamic analysis approaches is essential for effective detection. By focusing on abnormal signals and patterns during runtime, we can better protect our software supply chains against evolving threats and maintain the integrity of the open source ecosystems.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>20+ Years in Tech: Things We Wish We Knew Sooner • Daniel Terhorst-North &amp; Kevlin Henney • GOTO 2024</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMWsp_ieheU</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/vMWsp_ieheU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 12:01:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This interview was recorded at GOTO Copenhagen 2024. #GOTOcon #GOTOcph

To achieve this goal, it is necessary to:Decide on the API architectural style.Choose the serialization format.Use efficient implementations of both.It’s always better to solve a general problem by breaking it down into smaller parts, so let’s take a closer look at each.We already have numerous API architectural styles, such as REST, RPC, and SOAP, to name a few. I would like to add our old friend to them — the Command Pattern, or more precisely, the Command Pattern over the network. Offering the following advantages, it can be a good candidate for this role:Provides a way to model transactions. Commands share a common interface and can perform multiple actions at a time, making them ideal for this purpose.Allows to save user actions as a list of Commands, which can be useful for logging user activities, replaying operations, or implementing auditing mechanisms.Provides Undo/Redo functionality.Follows the open/closed principle. New Commands can be added easily without modifying existing code.Enhances testability, as Commands can be tested in isolation.Let’s compare it with RPC.Why RPC? Because they are similar — both approaches involve performing an arbitrary action on the server.The most obvious difference is that the Command Pattern operates with Commands, whereas RPC relies on functions.II. Similar RepresentationDespite that, they look the same when transmitted over the network:That’s quite unexpected, isn’t it?III. Number of Actions at a TimeUnlike the Command Pattern, RPC can perform only one action at a time, which is not very convenient. Let’s look at the following function composition:RPC suggests to make two requests or have a function like , to reduce the number of round trips. The latter option, by the way, is not ideal. The desire to get rid of latency problems will affect the communication interface — it will become more broad and complex. This is, actually, what the guys from Cap’n Proto say. Offering own solution they describe this problem in more detail.On the other hand, function composition is not an issue for the Command Pattern:In general it allows to perform an unlimited number of actions with a single request, without adding interface complexity or compromising performance.IV. Commands Inside FunctionsRPC can actually be implemented using the Command Pattern. In this case, functions can simply send Commands to the server:Thus, all we need to know is how to deal with Commands. This knowledge is more versatile and allows to improve even existing RPC systems.Command Pattern ChallengesWhile offering a more flexible and general abstraction, the Command Pattern also introduces some challenges:Server should somehow distinguish one Command from another. : Before each Command, send its type.Commands must return results, and each Command can have its own. : Instead of returning, the Command itself can be responsible for sending one or more results back.During execution, a Command may encounter an error. How should it be handled? : If we want the client to know about this error, the Command can send it back as a result. In another case, the Command can terminate the connection with the client, returning an error to the Invoker.To limit its execution time, the Command must know when it was received by the server. This time may differ from the start of execution. : The Command can receive it as a parameter.That’s how the Command Pattern, adapted to our needs, might look. To see it in action, we need to consider one more thing.To send data somewhere, it must first be converted into a sequence of bytes. This can be done in various ways, which is why so many serialization formats exist. One of the most important metrics to consider is the number of bytes used by the format. The fewer bytes we need to transfer over the network, the faster our application will be.The MUS format was created with these thoughts in mind. It uses almost no metadata and is actually a fairly simple format. I don’t want to repeat myself a lot, so here’s a link where you can read more about it.And that’s all for the theory.The ideas described above have already been implemented for Go in the form of two libraries:  and .cmd-stream-go is a high-performance client-server library that implements the Command Pattern and:Can work over TCP, TLS or mutual TLS.Has an asynchronous client, that uses only one connection for both sending Commands and receiving Results.Supports the server streaming, i.e. a Command can send back multiple Results.Provides reconnect and keepalive features.Supports the Circuit Breaker pattern.Has OpenTelemetry integration.Can work with various serialization formats.Has a modular architecture.mus-go is a MUS format serializer, it:Represents a set of serialization primitives that can be used to implement not only MUS but also other serialization formats.Can run on both 32 and 64-bit systems.Can validate and skip data while unmarshalling.Can serialize data structures such as graphs or linked lists.Supports data versioning.Supports out-of-order deserialization.Supports zero allocation deserialization.In addition, as you can see in the benchmarks, it demonstrates excellent performance:NS/OP — Nanoseconds per operation.B/SIZE — Number of bytes used to encode the data.B/OP — Number of bytes allocated per operation.ALLOCS/OP — Number of allocations per operation.Among these examples, you can find one where  is used as a communication tool for the RPC approach. As for benchmarks,  is about 3 times faster than :Sending Commands is a pretty good abstraction. It’s similar to RPC, but doesn’t limit us to just one action. Moreover, the Command Pattern can either replace RPC or be used as a tool for building it. Also it offers several advantages mentioned above and already has the high-performance implementation. All of this makes the Command Pattern a great choice for an API architectural style.Command Pattern Over the Network →]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ubuntu 25.10 Snapshot 2 Released</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Ubuntu-25.10-Snapshot-2</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 11:47:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Last month Canonical announced plans for releasing monthly Ubuntu Linux development snapshots and was followed by the Questing Snapshot 1 release in the road toward Ubuntu 25.10.

Imagine an AI-powered assistant that not only retrieves the most relevant papers but also summarizes key insights and answers your specific questions, all in real-time.This article delves into constructing such an AI research agent using Superlinked's complex document embedding capabilities. By integrating semantic and temporal relevance, we eliminate the need for complex reranking, ensuring efficient and accurate retrieval of information.Build a real-time AI research agent using Superlinked's vector search. It skips complex RAG pipelines by embedding and querying documents directly—making research faster, simpler, and smarter.(Want to jump straight to the code? Check out the open source on GitHub . Ready to try semantic search for your own agentic use case? )This article shows how to build an agent system using a Kernel agent to handle queries. If you want to follow along and run the code in-browser, Where to start building a research assistant system?Traditionally, building such a system involves complexity and considerable resource investment. Search systems typically retrieve an initial broad set of documents based on relevance and subsequently apply a secondary reranking process to refine and reorder results. While reranking enhances accuracy, it significantly increases computational complexity, latency, and overhead due to the extensive data retrieval initially required. Superlinked addresses this complexity by combining structured numeric and categorical embeddings with semantic text embeddings, providing comprehensive multimodal vectors. This method significantly enhances search accuracy by preserving attribute-specific information within each embedding.Build an agentic system with SuperlinkedThis AI agent can do three main things:Find Papers: Search for research papers by topic (e.g. “quantum computing”) and then rank them by relevance and recency.Summarize papers: Condense the retrieved papers into bite-sized insights.Answer questions: Extract answers directly from the specific research papers based on targeted user queries.Superlinked eliminates the need for re-ranking methods as it improves the vector search relevance. Superlinked's RecencySpace will be used which specifically encodes temporal metadata, prioritizing recent documents during retrieval, and eliminating the need for computationally expensive reranking. For example, if two papers have the same relevance - the one that is most recent will rank higher.To make things easier and more modular, I created an Abstract Tool class. This will simplify the process of building and adding toolsimport pandas as pd
import superlinked.framework as sl
from datetime import timedelta
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from openai import OpenAI
import os
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import Any, Optional, Dict
from tqdm import tqdm
from google.colab import userdata

# Abstract Tool Class
class Tool(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def name(self) -> str:
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def description(self) -> str:
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def use(self, *args, **kwargs) -> Any:
        pass


# Get API key from Google Colab secrets
try:
    api_key = userdata.get('OPENAI_API_KEY')
except KeyError:
    raise ValueError("OPENAI_API_KEY not found in user secrets. Please add it using Tools > User secrets.")

# Initialize OpenAI Client
api_key = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY", "your-openai-key")  # Replace with your OpenAI API key
if not api_key:
    raise ValueError("Please set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.")

client = OpenAI(api_key=api_key)
model = "gpt-4"
Step 2 : Understanding the DatasetThis example uses a dataset containing approximately 10,000 AI research papers available on Kaggle. To make it easy, simply run the cell below, and it will automatically download the dataset to your working directory. You may also use your own data sources, such as research papers or other academic content. If you decide to do so, all you need to do is adjust the schema design slightly and update the column names.import pandas as pd

!wget --no-check-certificate 'https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1FCR3TW5yLjGhEmm-Uclw0_5PWVEaLk1j' -O arxiv_ai_data.csv
\
For now, to make things run a bit quicker, we will use a smaller subset of the papers just to speed things up but feel free to try the example using the full dataset. An important technical detail here is that the timestamps from the dataset will be converted from string timestamps (like '1993-08-01 00:00:00+00:00') into pandas datetime objects. This conversion is necessary because it allows us to perform date/time operations.df = pd.read_csv('arxiv_ai_data.csv').head(100)

# Convert to datetime but keep it as datetime (more readable and usable)
df['published'] = pd.to_datetime(df['published'])

# Ensure summary is a string
df['summary'] = df['summary'].astype(str)

# Add 'text' column for similarity search
df['text'] = df['title'] + " " + df['summary']
Debug: Columns in original DataFrame: ['authors', 'categories', 'comment', 'doi', 'entry_id', 'journal_ref' 'pdf_url', 'primary_category', 'published', 'summary', 'title', 'updated']
Understanding the Dataset ColumnsBelow is a brief overview of the key columns in our dataset, which will be important in the upcoming steps:: The publication date of the research paper.: The abstract of the paper, providing a concise overview.: The unique identifier for each paper from arXiv.For this demonstration, we specifically focus on four columns: , , , and . To optimize retrieval quality, the title and summary are combined into a single, comprehensive text column, which forms the core of our embedding and search process.A Note on Superlinked’s In-Memory Indexer : Superlinked’s in-memory indexing stores our dataset directly in RAM, making retrieval exceptionally fast which is ideal for real-time searches and rapid prototyping. For this proof-of-concept with 1,000 research papers, leveraging an in-memory approach significantly enhances query performance, eliminating delays associated with disk access.Step 3 : Defining the Superlinked SchemaTo move ahead, there is a need for schema to map our data. We have set up  with key fields:lass PaperSchema(sl.Schema):
    text: sl.String
    published: sl.Timestamp  # This will handle datetime objects properly
    entry_id: sl.IdField
    title: sl.String
    summary: sl.String

paper = PaperSchema()
Defining Superlinked Spaces for Effective RetrievalAn essential step in organizing and effectively querying our dataset involves defining two specialized vector spaces: TextSimilaritySpace and RecencySpace.The  is designed to encode textual information—such as the titles and abstracts of research papers into vectors. By converting text into embeddings, this space significantly enhances the ease and accuracy of semantic searches. It is optimized specifically to handle longer text sequences efficiently, enabling precise similarity comparisons across documents.text_space = sl.TextSimilaritySpace(
    text=sl.chunk(paper.text, chunk_size=200, chunk_overlap=50),
    model="sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2"
)
The  captures temporal metadata, emphasizing the recency of research publications. By encoding timestamps, this space assigns greater significance to newer documents. As a result, retrieval results naturally balance content relevance with publication dates, favoring recent insights.recency_space = sl.RecencySpace(
    timestamp=paper.published,
    period_time_list=[
        sl.PeriodTime(timedelta(days=365)),      # papers within 1 year
        sl.PeriodTime(timedelta(days=2*365)),    # papers within 2 years
        sl.PeriodTime(timedelta(days=3*365)),    # papers within 3 years
    ],
    negative_filter=-0.25
)
\
Think of RecencySpace as a time-based filter, similar to sorting your emails by date or viewing Instagram posts with the newest ones first. It helps answer the question, 'How fresh is this paper?'Smaller timedeltas (like 365 days) allow for more granular, yearly time-based rankings.Larger timedeltas (like 1095 days) create broader time periods.The  penalizes very old papers. To explain it more clearly, consider the following example where two papers have identical content relevance, but their rankings will depend on their publication dates.Paper A: Published in 1996 
Paper B: Published in 1993

Scoring example:
- Text similarity score: Both papers get 0.8
- Recency score:
  - Paper A: Receives the full recency boost (1.0)
  - Paper B: Gets penalized (-0.25 due to negative_filter)

Final combined scores:
- Paper A: Higher final rank
- Paper B: Lower final rank
\
These spaces are key to making the dataset more accessible and effective. They allow for both content-based and time-based searches, and really helpful in understanding the relevance and recency of research papers. This provides a powerful way to organize and search through the dataset based on both the content and the publication time.Step 4 : Building the indexNext, the spaces are fused into an index which is the search engine's core:paper_index = sl.Index([text_space, recency_space])Then the DataFrame is mapped to the schema and loaded in batches (10 papers at a time) into an in-memory store:# Parser to map DataFrame columns to schema fields
parser = sl.DataFrameParser(
    paper,
    mapping={
        paper.entry_id: "entry_id",
        paper.published: "published",
        paper.text: "text",
        paper.title: "title",
        paper.summary: "summary",
    }
)

# Set up in-memory source and executor
source = sl.InMemorySource(paper, parser=parser)
executor = sl.InMemoryExecutor(sources=[source], indices=[paper_index])
app = executor.run()

# Load the DataFrame with a progress bar using batches
batch_size = 10
data_batches = [df[i:i + batch_size] for i in range(0, len(df), batch_size)]
for batch in tqdm(data_batches, total=len(data_batches), desc="Loading Data into Source"):
    source.put([batch])
\
The in-memory executor is why Superlinked shines here—1,000 papers fit snugly in RAM, and queries fly without disk I/O bottlenecks.Step 5 : Crafting the queryNext is the query creation. This is where the template for crafting queries is created. To manage this, we need a query template that can balance both relevance and recency. Here’s what that would look like:# Define the query
knowledgebase_query = (
    sl.Query(
        paper_index,
        weights={
            text_space: sl.Param("relevance_weight"),
            recency_space: sl.Param("recency_weight"),
        }
    )
    .find(paper)
    .similar(text_space, sl.Param("search_query"))
    .select(paper.entry_id, paper.published, paper.text, paper.title, paper.summary)
    .limit(sl.Param("limit"))
)
\
This allows us to pick whether to prioritize the content (relevanceweight) or the recency (recencyweight) - a very useful combo for our agent's needs.Now comes the tooling part.We will be creating three tools … : This tool is crafted by plugging into Superlinked’s index, letting it pull the top 5 papers based on a query. It balances relevance (1.0 weight) and recency (0.5 weight) to accomplish the “find papers” goal. What we want is to find the papers which are relevant to the query. So, if the query is: “What quantum computing papers were published between 1993 and 1994?”, then the retrieval tool will retrieve those papers, summarize them one by one, and return the results.class RetrievalTool(Tool):
    def __init__(self, df, app, knowledgebase_query, client, model):
        self.df = df
        self.app = app
        self.knowledgebase_query = knowledgebase_query
        self.client = client
        self.model = model

    def name(self) -> str:
        return "RetrievalTool"

    def description(self) -> str:
        return "Retrieves a list of relevant papers based on a query using Superlinked."

    def use(self, query: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
        result = self.app.query(
            self.knowledgebase_query,
            relevance_weight=1.0,
            recency_weight=0.5,
            search_query=query,
            limit=5
        )
        df_result = sl.PandasConverter.to_pandas(result)
        # Ensure summary is a string
        if 'summary' in df_result.columns:
            df_result['summary'] = df_result['summary'].astype(str)
        else:
            print("Warning: 'summary' column not found in retrieved DataFrame.")
        return df_result
\
Next up is the . This tool is designed for cases where a concise summary of a paper is needed. In order to use it, it will be provided with , which is the ID of the paper that needs to be summarized. If a  is not provided, the tool will not work as these IDs are a requirement in order to find the corresponding papers in the dataset.class SummarizationTool(Tool):
    def __init__(self, df, client, model):
        self.df = df
        self.client = client
        self.model = model

    def name(self) -> str:
        return "SummarizationTool"

    def description(self) -> str:
        return "Generates a concise summary of specified papers using an LLM."

    def use(self, query: str, paper_ids: list) -> str:

        if papers.empty:
            return "No papers found with the given IDs."
        summaries = papers['summary'].tolist()
        summary_str = "\n\n".join(summaries)
        prompt = f"""
        Summarize the following paper summaries:\n\n{summary_str}\n\nProvide a concise summary.

        response = self.client.chat.completions.create(

At this stage, all components of the Research Agent System have been configured. The system can now be initialized by providing the Kernel Agent with the appropriate tools, after which the Research Agent System will be fully operational.retrieval_tool = RetrievalTool(df, app, knowledgebase_query, client, model)
summarization_tool = SummarizationTool(df, client, model)
question_answering_tool = QuestionAnsweringTool(retrieval_tool, client, model)

# Initialize KernelAgent
kernel_agent = KernelAgent(retrieval_tool, summarization_tool, question_answering_tool, client, model)

Now let's test the system..# Test query print(kernel_agent.process_query("Find papers on quantum computing in last 10 years"))Running this activates the . It will fetch the relevant papers based on both relevance and recency, and return the relevant columns. If the returned result includes the summary column (indicating the papers were retrieved from the dataset), it will use those summaries and return them to us.Query type: retrieval

This paper discusses the challenges of learning logic programs that contain the cut predicate (!). Traditional learning methods cannot handle clauses with cut because it has a procedural meaning. The proposed approach is to first generate a candidate base program that covers positive examples, and then make it consistent by inserting cut where needed. Learning programs with cut is difficult due to the need for intensional evaluation, and current induction techniques may need to be limited to purely declarative logic languages.

I hope this example has been helpful for developing AI agents and agent-based systems. Much of the retrieval functionality demonstrated here was made possible by Superlinked, so please consider starring the repository for future reference when accurate retrieval capabilities are needed for your AI agents!Combining semantic and temporal relevance eliminates complex reranking while maintaining search accuracy for research papers.Time-based penalties (negative_filter=-0.25) prioritize recent research when papers have similar content relevance.Modular tool-based architecture allows specialized components to handle distinct tasks (retrieval, summarization, question-answering) while maintaining system cohesion.Loading data in small batches (batch_size=10) with progress tracking improves system stability when processing large research datasets.Adjustable query weights let users balance relevance (1.0) and recency (0.5) based on specific research needs.The question-answering component gracefully degrades to general knowledge when paper-specific context is unavailable, preventing dead-end user experiences.Keeping up-to-date with the vast number of research papers published regularly can be challenging and time-consuming. An agentic AI assistant workflow capable of efficiently locating relevant research, summarizing key insights, and answering specific questions from these papers could significantly streamline this process.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cocaine use and production hits record high</title><link>https://www.rte.ie/news/world/2025/0626/1520402-cocaine-un-report/</link><author>/u/JONFER---</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 11:35:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cocaine production, seizures and use all hit record highs in 2023, the UN drug agency said, with the illicit drug's market the world's fastest-growing.Illegal production jumped to 3,708 tonnes, nearly 34% more than in 2022, and more than four times higher than ten years earlier, when it was at a low, the Vienna-based UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said in its annual report.The current surge is mainly due to an increase in the size of the area under illicit coca bush cultivation in Colombia and updated yield data, it added.Global cocaine seizures, too, recorded a high of 2,275 tonnes, marking a 68% rise in the four years to 2023.The number of cocaine users also grew to 25 million in 2023, up from 17 million, ten years earlier."Cocaine has become fashionable for the more affluent society," UNODC chief researcher Angela Me said, noting a "vicious cycle" of increased use and production.While Colombia remains the key producer, cocaine traffickers are breaking into new markets across Asia and Africa, according to the report, with organised crime groups from the Western Balkans increasing their influence."North America, Western and Central Europe and South America continue to constitute the largest markets for cocaine, on the basis of the number of people who used drugs in the past year and on data derived from wastewater analysis."A new era of global instability has intensified challenges in addressing the world drug problem, empowering organised crime groups and pushing drug use to historically high levels," UNODC noted.In 2023, the percent of the people aged between 15 and 64 estimated to have used a drug was 6%, compared to 5.2% of the population in 2013.Cannabis remains the most widely used drug.Seizures of amphetamine-type stimulants reached a record high in 2023, making up almost half of all global seizures of synthetic drugs, followed by synthetic opioids, including fentanyl, UNODC said.The leading drugs there were methamphetamine and amphetamine.The fall of ruler Bashar al-Assad in Syria last December has "created uncertainty around the future of the captagon trade", UNODC added.Earlier this month, Syria said authorities had seized all production facilities of the illicit stimulant, which became Syria's largest export under the Assad regime."The latest seizure data from 2024 and 2025 confirm that captagon is continuing to flow - primarily to countries of the Arabian peninsula - possibly indicating the release of previously-accumulated stockpiles or continued production in different locations," UNODC said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Russian Agents Burn Military Trucks in Erfurt, Germany</title><link>https://militarnyi.com/uk/news/rosiyany-opublikuvaly-kadry-pidpalu-vijskovoyi-tehniky-u-nimechchyni/</link><author>/u/r0w33</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 11:30:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Підпишіться на розсилку наших новин]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Russia unveils Kremlin-sanctioned communications app MAX | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhxbifaVtI</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/MXhxbifaVtI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 11:27:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Russia has unveiled an app that combines messaging with other functions.

For  now, every time I wanted to make a change, I would:Build a new statically linked binary (with --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl)So instead, I'd like to switch to deploying my website with containers (be it Docker, Kubernetes, or otherwise),
matching the vast majority of software deployed any time in the last decade.The only issue is that fast Rust builds with Docker are not simple.Rust in Docker, the simple wayTo get your Rust program in a container, the typical approach you might find would be something
like:Unfortunately, this will rebuild everything from scratch whenever there's any change.In my case, building from scratch takes about 4 minutes (including 10s to download the crates every time).Sure, it could be worse. But I've grown accustomed to speedy local builds, thanks to incremental compilation — I don't
want to wait that long on every tiny change!Rust in Docker, with better cachingThankfully, there's a tool to help with this!Luca Palmieri's  makes it easy to pre-build all of the dependencies as a separate layer in the docker
build cache, so that changes in your codebase only trigger re-compilation of your codebase (and not your dependencies).I'll save the detailed explanation for Luca's blog post, but broadly  creates a simplified "recipe" file from
the current workspace, which can be "cooked" to cache the dependencies without being invalidated by changes in the
workspace.My website pulls in a few hundred dependencies, so this  help!...

Unfortunately though, it doesn't have quite the speedup we're looking for — most of the time is still in the final
binary:Weirdly, only 25% of the time is actually spent on the dependencies! As far as I could tell, my code isn't doing
anything fundamentally unreasonable. It's ~7k lines of gluing together various larger dependencies (, ,
, among others.)(Just to double-check, I tried running  with . It really was just a single
invocation of  that took almost 3 minutes!)What's  doing for all that time?In addition to that cargo-timing-<timestamp>.html file, there's also a . We'll
just copy out the canonical version:...

And with a little bit of container wrangling... cargo-timing.html
 container ... we should be able to see what's going on! Let's have a look: There's not really much information there! shows a bunch of information about how long each crate took to compile. But here, we only care
about the compilation time of the final crate!That aside, this does help give us more accurate timing. Measuring outside the compiler adds some extra moving
pieces, or requires searching the output of  — so using 's self-reported timings will make more
precise analysis a bit easier, later on.Just to check, the value here of 174.1s roughly matches the "2m 54s" we saw from the  output.Actually asking  this timeThe post from fasterthanlime had one more tip we can use — 's self-profiling feature, via the 
flag.Normally, you'd probably run something like: rustc  --  self-profile
(note: This is using  to pass extra flags to , with  to allow using the 
unstable flags on a stable compiler.)Unfortunately, this won't work here — the change in arguments will invalidate the cached dependencies from
, and there's no equivalent way to pass additional  flags through .Instead, we can funnel everything via the  environment variable: chef cook .

 build .
This gives us files like web_http_server-<random-number>.mm_profdata, which we can move and extract from the image in
the same way as we did for .(note: It's much easier to automate if we remove the profiling data that was added from  before the
final build. That's omitted here, for brevity.)Actually using the profdata – produces plaintext output summarizing the profiling dataBut let's install a couple of these to take a look at what we've got: https://github.com/rust-lang/measureme flamegraph summarize
I personally use Firefox, so we'll hold off on the chrome tracing stuff for now.First, with  (which itself has the  and  subcommands):So at a high level, the two biggest things are link-time optimization (LTO) and
LLVM_module_codegen_emit_obj, whatever that is.Let's see if we can dig a bit deeper with the flamegraph:(It's interactive! If you're curious, you can click through and play around with it yourself.)So there's presumably some inter-mingling going on between codegen and LTO: codegen_module_perform_lto ends up falling
through to both / and .But either way, we've got a problem with LTO: codegen_module_perform_lto took ~80% of the total time.It's time to talk about LTOThe Rust compiler splits up crates into "codegen units", handing each to LLVM as a separate module to compile.
, optimizations take place within each codegen unit, and then they're linked together at the end.LTO controls the set of optimizations that LLVM will make during that link-time — for example, inlining or
optimization across codegen units."thin" LTO — in theory, similar performance benefits to "fat" LTO, but less expensive to run"fat" LTO — maximum amount of LTO, across all crates at the same timeAnd if the LTO option is not specified,  uses "thin local LTO", which limits "thin" LTO only to a single crate at
a time.What are the current settingsTurns out that a few years back, I had set  in my :And, while we're at it,  enables all debug symbols (where they'd normally be excluded by default for the
 profile). Maybe we should take a look at that as well.Tweaking the (normal) settingsLet's take a look at the compile times and binary sizes for a variety of  and  settings (using
 like before, for more precise timing).At a high level: It seems like the worst cases here are full debug symbols adding 30-50% to the compilation time, and
"fat" LTO taking about  than with LTO fully disabled.That mostly tracks with what we'd expect from the documentation — yeah, fat LTO takes longer. But when we disable
everything, we're still looking at 50 seconds compiling the final binary!A brief note: 50 seconds is , actually!Look, 50 seconds is already a great improvement — and if it requires disabling LTO and debug symbols... my website
gets approximately zero load. It would be totally fine. It would be perfectly sustainable, even!There's no practical reason to keep digging here.But where's the fun in leaving it there? We should be able to do better, right?Another brief note: Can't we just use incremental compilation?It's slightly more complicated, but yes, absolutely — for local development, at least. Consistently loading the build
cache isn't straightforward, but you'd want to make the  directory accessible with a "cache mount" in the
dockerfile, and persist that target directory between builds.That said, I value that  have a clean environment every time, and I think it's worthwhile to go
through docker's own caching system — which is why I'm using  in the first place.Digging deeper: Et tu, ?If we disable LTO and debug symbols, compiling the final binary still takes 50 seconds to do... something.Let's re-run the self-profiling to check out what's going on.It's ~70% just  — i.e. where LLVM is optimizing the code. Before diving into LLVM itself, let's
see if there's any easier knobs we can tune.The  profile uses  by default — maybe if we reduce the optimization level, we'll spend less
time on it.We can actually do one better — since our dependencies are cached, and we only care about the final binary, we can get
most of the benefits by only reducing optimizations on the final binary:Like the previous options, there's a handful of s we can choose from:, , and  enable increasing levels of optimizations and  are different flavors of prioritizing binary sizeGoing through a handful of combinations here again:The baseline for  level of optimizations on the final binary is about 50 secondsIf we disable all optimizations, then it's pretty quick: only ~15sRust relies pretty heavily on optimizations, and while it'd probably be fine to just blanket-disable them for the final
binary, it'd be pretty cool if we can at least keep  optimizations!So let's try to figure out what's taking so long.'s self-profiling doesn't give us any more detail though,
so we'll have to get it from LLVM. – emit LLVM profiling information as plaintext – emit LLVM profiling information in the chrome tracing format (again with that one!)Profiling LLVM with  — plain textLike before, let's skip the chrome tracing format for now, and see what we can get from plain text. chef cook .

 build .
... Unfortunately if you try to  again, you'll immediately hit something like:[output clipped, log limit 2MiB reached]
This is because BuildKit (if you're using ~recent Docker on Linux) has default output limits that are pretty small.So after getting unlimited  output on the terminal, what's in it?
 — probably not what you want to be copying from your terminal, anyways.So, redirecting to a file inside docker and copying that out like before, we get a bunch of pass/analysis timing
reports. They each look something like this:===-------------------------------------------------------------------------===

It certainly is  to parse and analyze these! But it's also hard to be certain about what you're looking at
when each pass execution is emitted separately and multi-threading can interfere with timing.Let's see if there's a better way to get good data.Profiling LLVM with  — actual tracing this timeWe skipped  earlier because it emits the chrome tracing format. chef cook .

 build .
It produces a bunch of $package-$hash.llvm_timings.json files, alongside the normal compilation artifacts:(Why ? Setting up rootless docker didn't work when I tried it a few years back, and I haven't bothered since)So, deleting  between  and the final build, we can extract the singular profile for the
final binary into web_http_server.llvm_timings.json.There's just one minor hiccup:It's . It's also all one single line!In theory though, a wide variety of tools should be able to process this:None of these options worked for me — but it's a big JSON file with a known format, how hard can it be?Turns out, a 1.4GiB single line of JSON makes all the normal tools complain:If you try to view it with , scrolling blocks on processing the entire fileIf you try to process it with , it has to load the entire 1.4GiB into 's internal format (which expectedly
takes up  more than the original 1.4GiB)Vim hangs when you open itAnd you probably don't want to just  it to the terminal — again, it's 1.4GiB!So instead, we can just look at a few hundred characters, at the start and end of the file:Matching this to the "JSON Object Format" from the chrome tracing spec, it seems we have a single JSON object like:
    ...
  We'd be able to process it with normal tools if we split each event into its own object. That could be something like: web_http_server.llvm_timings.json  web-http-server.llvm_timings.jsonl
(i.e.: turn  into a newline, strip the start of the object, strip the end of the object)And  we can process this.What's in LLVM's trace events?It looks like these events all have .According to the spec, the  field gives the type of event, and  refers to "complete" events, recording how long a
particular piece of work took on a given thread (). The duration in microseconds is given by .Aside from that, we also have  events:These are "metadata" events — in our case, not much useful information.And aside from these, there's nothing else:Going back to those  events — there were a bunch of them with . What else do we have?Neat! It looks like we might be able to demangle some of the symbols to get timings on individual functions.If we track what's being run and how long it takes, we should be able to get a better sense of why our compile time is
so long.Later on, there's aggregate information for certain types of events, like . These are equivalent to
the sum of the duration for that event type (in this case, ). Let's see kind of operations are taking the
most time:This particular run took ~110 seconds on a 16-core machine, so it's clear that some passes are being double-counted
(which makes sense — we see both , and it looks like 
probably just calls ).But broadly, it seems like optimization () and inlining () are the two parts taking a lot of
time — let's see if we can do anything about it.Can we make  any faster?LLVM has a bunch of arguments that can be configured, which  exposes through the  flag. At time of
writing (June 2025), there's somewhere in the region of ~100 options that mention inlining (via rustc -C llvm-args='--help-list-hidden').
In particular, there's a bunch of relevant options in the file controlling the cost analysis.Now, I'll be honest, I know  about LLVM's inlining. Most of the options refer to the "cost" associated
with the inlining, or with the function being inlined, etc. I'm flying mostly bind here. But there's a few arguments
that seem like decent candidates for tuning:--inlinedefault-threshold=225 — "Default amount of inlining to perform" — "Control the amount of inlining to perform"--inlinehint-threshold=325 — "Threshold for inlining functions with inline hint"For all of these, the "threshold" roughly means "allow inlining functions with cost  the threshold", so a higher
threshold means more inlining.So if we set all of these to some value (e.g., ), we should see that there's less inlining, and in turn faster
compile times..
(Why separate ? I couldn't find a way to make the whitespace happy through the  environment
variable — maybe it's possible if you set  in , but this solution worked 🤷)In any case, reducing to a threshold of 50  end up faster! About 42.2s, down from 48.8s.Here's what that looks like across a handful of values:(note: The smallest value is 1, and not zero. Why 1? Sometimes zero has special behavior – setting to one seemed like a safer bet.)Of these, it's hard to say exactly what the best value is, but for my use case (remember: my website gets ~zero load!),
setting the thresholds to 10 looks promising. We'll hold off on that for now though.Can we make  any faster?Optimizing functions was the other expensive task we saw.The knobs here are much less clear to me (we're already at , and  compeltely disables
optimizations). So, let's see what exactly is taking so long.First, a brief look at the event format:In its raw form, each of the events'  field has the mangled symbol of the function being optimized. We can
"demangle" these back to the original Rust symbols with  — for example:It's worth noting that in the list above, while there's several serde_json::value::to_value items, they actually have
distinct hashes:... which makes sense, given that serde_json::value::to_value is a generic function — it might be that it's being
optimized with different generic parameters ("monomorphizations").Wait, why are we optimizing functions from other crates?The short answer is that optimization is done in the context of the crate where a function is monomorphized. So if we
define a type  and then call methods on , those methods  will first exist in the
context of our crate — meaning it gets compiled and optimized with the same configuration as our crate.With some knowledge about how the compiler works under the hood, this should hopefully make some sense — but from the
outside, it's certainly a little odd!What's actually taking so long?Now that we know what we're looking at, we can start doing some analysis. For example, by finding the individual
functions we spent the most time optimizing:(Why two separate  invocations? If we did just one, the / call would load the entire file
into a single array before any processing, which is one of the key operations we're trying to avoid)This is a surprising amount of time on individual functions! Profiling roughly doubled the total time to compile, but
even 1 second optimizing a single function is quite a long time!But let's look into more detail here. We've got:web_http_server::photos::PhotosState::new::{{closure}} — this is  closure inside a giant, 400-line async
function that does the setup for https://sharnoff.io/photosweb_http_server::run::{{closure}} — this is inside the main entrypoint (also async), but all the closures are small
error-handling, like .wrap_err_with(|| format!("failed to bind address {addr:?}"))Maybe there's something weird going on here!... and a handful of dependencies that also took a while:, we could break it down by the outermost crate:This is, of course, a very imperfect measure — the outermost crate isn't necessarily the best one to attribute the
compilation time to, and there's a lot of items like  that aren't captured by this simple filtering.
But all that aside, it's still surprising that there's so much from !Digging more into closures, with mangling v0The long compile times for closures seems very suspicious — maybe it's worth digging further. There's just one
problem: the symbols all end with  without saying  is taking all the time.As it turns out, there's an easy fix! As of June 2025,  currently uses the "legacy" symbol mangling format by
default, but there's a newer option with more information: the v0 format.We can enable it by adding RUSTFLAGS="-C symbol-mangling-version=v0" to our existing flags, which now look something
like:RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP=1 RUSTFLAGS="-Csymbol-mangling-version=v0 -Zllvm-time-trace" cargo build --timings ...
(aside: The issue for that feature's been open for 6 years, why hasn't it been merged yet? Turns out, there's a lot of
upstream work required to add support in common tools like  and . A lot of that has been done, but not yet
everything.)The end result of this is that we get  better symbols coming out of the LLVM trace. As an example, here's what
those serde_json::value::to_value symbols look like now:So not only do we get better closure labeling (see e.g. ) but we also get full generics for everything!Exactly what's taking so long  be much clearer now:... but those first few closures are : is_jpg  path s app  feed And if we remove these closures, replacing them with separately defined functions where possible, LLVM  reports
taking a long time to optimize  in the outer function.So where are those closures coming from?After dumping the LLVM IR with RUSTFLAGS="--emit=llvm-ir" (which places it into ) and searching
through the generated functions, I found a line like:That  function was a nested async function, defined directly inside  — so why did the
symbol say it was defined inside a closure?It's because internally represents async functions/blocks with a nested closure. So all of these places that
we had async functions where compiling  took a long time were actually just referring to the function itself!With some quick github searching (is:issue state:open async fn closure mangle), it turned out there was already an
open issue about this!Big async functions considered harmful?Going back to our list from before – those async functions where LLVM takes a long time to optimize  are
really just spending a long time on the body of the function itself. It would make sense that big functions are hard to
optimize, and async functions doubly so.It's  straightforward to identify all of the functions inside the main crate that are taking a long time:Some of the most expensive functions here are around setup.Let's try breaking up just one function, to see if it helps. We'll start with .On the first attempt, I tried breaking it up while also preserving the number of s – it's easy to do both
accidentally, and this would hopefully isolate which type of complexity is causing problems.Interestingly, this didn't help all that much: only reducing the total time from 5.3s to 4.7s.So to add to that, I tried merging a handful of neighboring s into their own functions — reducing the total
number from 10 to 3.But that took substantially longer! It increased from 4.66s to 6.24s!At this point, it seemed like there was something strange happening with async functions. Otherwise, why would splitting
into more functions make things worse?Under the hood, async functions desugar to a complex state machine. There might be something odd happening there, so if
we want to make that simpler in the caller, we can turn the  into a trait object to obscure the implementation
behind it (typically ).So this time, let's add a new function like:
    futfutand using it everywhere we . For example: candidates  candidates This one worked — down to 2.14s.So, a reduction from 5.3s to 2.14s – a notable improvement, albeit with a lot of effort to get there. (and, for the
record, when I wrapped the futures with  instead of a fresh function, it didn't make a difference here).Re-running the build without profiling, this gives a total reduction from 48.8s to 46.8s. It's pretty small, but that's
from just a single function!(Aside: What about ? I tried it with and without – after boxing, compile times weren't any better
with inlining disabled for those functions, but it's still helpful for ensuring better attribution on the LLVM
timings.)(Aside: What about disabling inlining on the  functions? I also tried wrapping the async functions with a
 implementation having  on its poll function. That helped , but wasn't as good as
boxing.)There's a number of approaches available — let's try:Reducing inlining with LLVM args;Breaking up expensive functions in the main crate; andRemoving generics from dependencies to prevent needing to compile it in the main crateSo, updating the final Dockerfile commands to read:

...

... and many more small changes to the main crate:... alongside some changes to larger dependencies:... gives us a final compile time of .Disabling LTO (and debug symbols!) got us to 51s (-71%) Changing to  on the final crate got us to 48.8s (-4%)Reducing inlining with  got us to 40.7s (-16%) Local changes got us to 37.7s (-7%) And changes with dependencies got us to 32.3s (-14%) While I did hit a lot of issues here, the tooling honestly worked really well – and the documentation was sufficient for
someone with relatively little experience to make meaningful improvements to their codebase.Some of the issues are straightforward: bugfixes to provide a nicer experience for the next person that finds themselves
in a similar mess.Others are more complicated:The compile time of deep call graphs of async functions needs to be improved – perhaps LLVM has a degenerate edge
case that's easy to trigger with what  generates, or maybe it's as simple as a bad heuristic that's
under-utilized in other languages.It  be worthwhile for  to special-case core::ptr::drop_in_place<T> so that it's compiled in the crate
that defines . That approach wouldn't work for everything – for example, generic types – but would prevent
downstream crates from needing to re-compile the same destructor multiple times.There might also be room for tooling to help with isolating which parts of a codebase are taking up the most time
during compilation (and providing recommendations to mitigate) – although that's a longer project than just this post.In the meantime, setting  might be just fine :)(questions? comments?

The upcoming Blender 5.0 3D modeling software application is introducing High Dynamic Range (HDR) display support on Linux when making use of Wayland -- no X11 support for HDR -- and Vulkan graphics accelerator.
HDR support for Blender 5.0 on Linux is currently considered experimental. Enabling the HDR support on Linux for the Blender creator software requires having a High Dynamic Range display (of course) and be running on a Wayland desktop, enabling Vulkan API acceleration rather than OpenGL, and enabling the feature currently deemed experimental.
As the Blender HDR support on Linux has been tested with a limited number of configurations so far, it's currently being treated as experimental. Depending upon testing feedback it may be promoted beyond being an "experiment" feature or Blender 5.0, so we'll see. In my testing of the latest Blender 5.0 alpha build on Ubuntu Linux with Samsung Odyssey OLED G8 G81SF and ASUS ROG Swift OLED PG27UCDM displays, this experimental feature was working out fine in my basic tests.
More details on this initial HDR support for Blender 5.0 on Linux with Vulkan/Wayland can see this Blender DevTalk thread for all the details and to share your feedback on any testing.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hello Europe!

Every click, every login, and every piece of data you generate across countless apps and platforms are collected and controlled by centralised entities. Now, the Moca Foundation is launching a direct challenge to this status quo with the announcement of Moca Chain, a new blockchain built from the ground up to restore ownership of your digital life to its rightful owner: you.\
The Moca Foundation unveiled its plans for a Layer 1 blockchain dedicated entirely to identity and user data. The Moca Chain, with its testnet and mainnet slated for launch in the third and fourth quarters of 2025 respectively, aims to create a new infrastructure where individuals, devices, and even AI agents can manage their digital credentials without relying on the corporate platforms that dominate the web today. This initiative is not just about privacy; it is about establishing a new paradigm for how user data is verified, shared, and valued in the digital economy.\
The core of the Moca Chain's design is to provide a secure and interoperable foundation for digital identity. It will function as a modular, EVM-compatible chain, which means it is designed to work seamlessly with the vast ecosystem of applications built on Ethereum and other compatible networks. At the heart of this new ecosystem will be the MOCA Coin, which will be used for all network activities, including transaction fees, staking by validators, and payments for data storage and verification services. This creates a self-sustaining economy around the management of digital identity.The Problem with a Centralized Digital WorldIn the current web landscape, convenience often comes at the cost of control. Services like single sign-on (SSO), which allow you to use one account (like Google or Facebook) to log into multiple applications, have become ubiquitous. While they simplify the user experience, they also create a significant vulnerability. As Yat Siu, the co-founder and executive chairman of Animoca Brands, points out, this model has deep-seated flaws. "Billions of users today go online using single sign-on (SSO), which contains the keys to a user’s data, services, and digital lives," Siu stated. "While convenient, SSO represents a centralized point of failure that compromises security while also allowing operators to aggressively extract value from users’ digital selves."\
This centralization means that large technology companies hold the keys to our digital kingdoms. Our data is siloed within their "walled gardens," where it is monetized for their benefit. This model not only exposes users to massive-scale data breaches but also prevents them from having a unified, portable identity that they can use across different services without compromising their privacy. The fragmentation of our digital identities across numerous platforms also makes it difficult to build a comprehensive and verifiable reputation that can be leveraged in various contexts, from professional networking to accessing financial services.\
Moca Chain directly confronts this issue by proposing a decentralized alternative. "Moca Chain seeks to solve this problem by giving users decentralized true ownership of their data, ensuring the sovereignty of users’ digital identity without a single point of failure," Siu explained. This vision aligns with the broader mission of Animoca Brands to champion digital property rights, empowering individuals to not only control their online activities and personal data but also to share more equitably in the value they generate.A New Infrastructure for Trust\
So, how does Moca Chain propose to solve these complex issues? The project is building a multi-faceted infrastructure designed for what it calls "self-sovereign identity." This concept revolves around the idea that individuals should have ultimate control over their own digital identities, just as they do with their physical identification documents. To achieve this, Moca Chain will allow both on-chain (data stored on a blockchain) and off-chain (data stored elsewhere) user data to be verified by any application on any blockchain. This is made possible through a combination of decentralized data storage, a cross-chain identity oracle, and advanced cryptographic methods.\
One of the key technologies Moca Chain will employ is web proof data generation, specifically through a method known as zkTLS. In simple terms, this allows for the verification of data from a web session without revealing the data itself, a powerful application of zero-knowledge proofs. For example, you could prove that you have a certain educational credential from a university's portal without actually sharing the certificate itself with a third-party application. This has profound implications for privacy across numerous industries, from healthcare, where patient data could be verified without being exposed, to finance, where know-your-customer (KYC) requirements could be met without sensitive documents being shared repeatedly.\
This technological stack will work in conjunction with the AIR Kit, a software development kit (SDK) from Moca Network, the identity ecosystem of Animoca Brands. The AIR Kit is already being integrated into a host of consumer applications, including those with massive user bases like SK Planet’s OK Cashbag, with its 28 million verified users, and One Football, which has over 200 million users. Kenneth Shek, the project lead of Moca Network, sees this as a pivotal move to disrupt the current model of data ownership. “Moca Chain and AIR Kit are a one-of-a-kind infrastructure for verified identity data to empower consumer apps and their users," Shek said. "By adopting Moca Chain and MOCA Coin, we believe we can disrupt current models of data ownership and break down the dominance of walled garden ecosystems, returning value to the users who generate it and making ecosystem growth more scalable.”\
The launch of Moca Chain represents a significant and ambitious step toward solving one of the most persistent problems of the digital age: the ownership and control of our personal data. The vision articulated by the Moca Foundation and its partners at Animoca Brands is not merely a technological one, it is fundamentally about rebalancing power in the digital world. The idea of a user-centric identity layer that is both private and interoperable has been a long-held goal for many in the Web3 space, but the practical implementation has always been the primary hurdle.\
What makes Moca Chain a particularly noteworthy project is its pragmatic approach to adoption. By integrating its AIR Kit into established Web2 platforms with hundreds of millions of users, it is building a bridge for mainstream adoption rather than expecting users to jump headfirst into a completely new and unfamiliar ecosystem. This strategy of meeting users where they are could be the key to achieving the network effects necessary for a new identity standard to take hold.\
However, the path ahead will not be without its challenges. The project will need to navigate a complex regulatory landscape, particularly in sensitive areas like finance and healthcare. Furthermore, it will have to convince both developers and end-users that its solution is not only more secure and equitable but also just as convenient as the centralized systems they are accustomed to. The success of Moca Chain will ultimately depend on its ability to deliver a seamless user experience that makes the benefits of self-sovereign identity tangible to the average person. If it succeeds, it could indeed lay the groundwork for a more equitable and user-empowered internet.\

Their meeting, along with others involving Russian intelligence chief Sergey Naryshkin and Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, signaled more than symbolic alignment. Outside Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service headquarters, Blaha declared, “Slovaks and Russians are brothers,” and described NATO as an aggressive force at fault for the war in Ukraine.Blaha’s language mirrored standard Kremlin narratives, but his platform gave them an unusual level of legitimacy within a European Union member state. In Moscow, he posed for photos, praised Russian strength, and publicly called for “Slovak-Russian friendship,” even as Russian forces continued their invasion of Ukraine and targeted civilian infrastructure.But it is not only public posturing that alarms observers. The VSquare report points to deeper concerns within the Slovak political system. One of Prime Minister Robert Fico’s key advisors, David Lindtner, is reportedly acting as an informal liaison between senior Slovak officials and Moscow-aligned actors. Lindtner, who has no public mandate in foreign affairs, has been described by national security sources as part of a “silent corridor” through which the Kremlin maintains influence over parts of the Slovak state.Slutsky, a longtime figure in Kremlin diplomacy, has increasingly positioned himself as a bridge to fringe European figures willing to echo Russia’s preferred narratives. From German AfD leaders to French extremists, and now to Slovak officials, his pattern is clear: elevate allies who reject Western consensus and spread disinformation under the guise of diplomacy.What makes the Slovak case especially dangerous, according to VSquare, is the normalization of these contacts. Unlike past far-right alliances with Moscow that existed outside power structures, SMER and its partners currently govern Slovakia. That means access to state intelligence, foreign policy briefings, and European decision-making channels.The strategy is subtle but effective: turn EU member states into vectors for Kremlin narratives, and weaponize internal politics to splinter European resolve.With Blaha amplifying Russian propaganda at home and Fico’s advisors engaging in opaque diplomacy abroad, Slovakia risks becoming a Trojan horse inside the European Union.The VSquare report ends with a warning—this is not just about Slovakia. It is a case study in how Russian intelligence co-opts democratic institutions using ideology, relationships, and deniable influence. And unless it is confronted with transparency and resolve, it will not stop at Bratislava.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>My Journey from Java to Go: Why I Think Go&apos;s Packages Are Actually Better</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1lkvjpi/my_journey_from_java_to_go_why_i_think_gos/</link><author>/u/hosmanagic</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 09:17:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When I was going through The Go Programming Language (Kernighan et al.), I thought I’d just skim the chapter on packages.

But sometimes, it costs people their lives…These are five real stories where being involved in crypto wasn’t just financially risky — it was fatal. Not because of bad trades, but because of kidnappings, threats, and murderSince 2018, there have been over 150 documented cases of crypto-related kidnappings, “wrench attacks,” and violent extortion attempts across North America, Europe, and Asia. In 2025 alone, 7 high-profile abductions were reported in France, including cases involving physical mutilation and ransom demands of up to €10 million.Financially, the numbers tell an alarming story. In 2023, total crypto ransom payments reached , nearly double the $567 million paid the year before. In 2024, the figure dropped to $814 million, but still reflects a massive sum of money used to fund coercion, violence, and organized crime.Let’s take a closer look at five high-profile tragedies that expose the deadly intersection of money, privacy, and risk in the crypto world.Kidnapped and Killed for Bitcoin in Kyiv (July 2024)In July 2024, news broke that a 29-year-old crypto investor had been kidnapped and murdered in Kyiv. According to BeInCrypto Russia, the victim was lured through social engineering — a fake meeting involving a car rental, where attackers posed as clients or partners. Once inside the vehicle, he was taken to an unknown location.His captors demanded access to his crypto holdings — about 3 BTC. That’s not a fortune by crypto standards, but in Ukraine, it’s well above the average yearly salary. The attackers were prepared. When the victim refused to give up access to his wallet, he was killed.The killers were arrested within a few days. But what stands out is the method: premeditated, organized, and directly targeting a crypto user. This wasn't a random mugging. It’s a reminder that once someone knows you're holding crypto, especially self-custodied assets, you're exposed — not digitally, but physically.Murder of Antonio Vinicius Lopes Gritzbach (Brazil, November 2024)Antonio Lopes Gritzbach was a Brazilian entrepreneur working with Bitcoin and reportedly linked to over-the-counter crypto operations. These kinds of OTC businesses are often used to convert large amounts of crypto into fiat discreetly. And in Brazil, the line between OTC and money laundering is often razor-thin.According to The Guardian, Gritzbach had been cooperating with prosecutors on a high-profile money laundering case. His death wasn’t random. He was shot multiple times in broad daylight, near the Guarulhos International Airport in São Paulo. Surveillance footage showed a car slowly trailing him before someone opened fire.Some local sources suggested Gritzbach had inside knowledge of crypto flows used by drug cartels and political interests. While these claims were never confirmed, it’s clear he wasn’t just an average Bitcoiner. His death shows the dangerous overlap between crypto and organized crime, especially in regions where the legal framework is still catching up.Death of Nikolai Mushegian — DeFi Pioneer or Target? (Puerto Rico, October 2022)Nikolai Mushegian was no stranger to crypto insiders. He co-founded , one of the biggest decentralized finance protocols. He also contributed to Balancer Labs and early stablecoin designs. A deeply technical person, Nikolai was also known for his paranoia — and for good reason.In the months leading up to his death, Mushegian had been tweeting erratically about being followed, bugged, and targeted by intelligence agencies. The tweet that shocked everyone came just hours before his death: he claimed the CIA, Mossad, and others were running blackmail operations and were planning to torture him. A few hours later, he drowned near Condado Beach, Puerto Rico. No foul play was found — but the beach was known for strong rip currents, and he was a strong swimmer.BeInCrypto and others covered the story, sparking endless speculation. Was it suicide? Was it paranoia turned real? Mushegian had been working on privacy-preserving tools and alternative financial systems — things that do challenge state power. Whether or not there’s more to the story, the crypto world lost one of its most brilliant and troubled minds.Tiantian Kullander — Young Billionaire, Sudden Death (Hong Kong, November 2022)Tiantian “TT” Kullander was just 30 years old when he passed away in his sleep, with no clear medical explanation. He co-founded , a major crypto trading and infrastructure company based in Hong Kong. Valued at over $3 billion at one point, the firm handled institutional trades, offered yield products, and had ties to major players like Temasek.TT was also a former trader at Morgan Stanley and a rising star in global finance. His death shocked the industry. Changelly reported the cause as “unexpected” with no further details.What spooked many wasn’t just the timing, but the pattern: his death followed the collapse of FTX by just days. Several other crypto executives died within the same 12-month window — including Nikolai Mushegian and Vyacheslav Taran. Online forums and Telegram groups exploded with theories, though no link has ever been confirmed.This case shows how little we know about what happens at the top of crypto finance — where money moves at speed and under intense pressure. Whether TT died of natural causes or something more complex, it left a massive hole in one of Asia’s biggest Web3 firms.The Stabbing of Bob Lee — Tech Icon with Crypto Ties (San Francisco, April 2023)Bob Lee was a Silicon Valley legend. He helped build Android at Google, launched Square’s Cash App, and was an early backer of many startups. In recent years, he got deep into crypto, joining the MobileCoin project — a privacy-focused coin aimed at messaging apps like Signal.In April 2023, Bob was stabbed to death in downtown San Francisco. The case made headlines because of who he was — not just a tech guy, but a powerful connector in both crypto and finance. Initial theories included robbery or a possible crypto deal gone wrong. But police later arrested a suspect known to Bob personally.Even though the motive turned out to be personal, the crypto world didn’t ignore the context. BeInCrypto and others noted how the killing fueled wider concerns: if someone like Bob Lee isn’t safe, how safe is anyone building cutting-edge tech that challenges traditional systems?How to Stay Safe in CryptoCrypto puts you in control, but that control comes with visibility — and visibility attracts risk. Criminals, extortionists, even governments are watching the space more closely than ever. If you hold significant assets or work on high-profile projects, you need to think about your security the way a public figure or whistleblower would.Don’t talk publicly about your holdings, not even in passing on Telegram or Twitter. Avoid connecting your real name to wallets or exchanges. Use aliases where possible, and treat your online identity as something separate from your real life. Store most of your assets in cold wallets, and never in one place. Use techniques like splitting keys or multisig to limit exposure. Backups should be offline, encrypted, and stored in more than one secure location.Be cautious with who you meet in the crypto space. Some attacks have started with what looked like harmless business conversations. Assume your messages could be read and your devices compromised. Use end-to-end encrypted tools like Signal or Session, and stay alert in both physical and digital environments.==Most importantly, remember this: blockchain isn’t anonymous==. Even if you’re operating legally, once you're in the public eye — as a developer, founder, or even a well-known trader — the risk of being targeted increases dramatically.Is Crypto Worth the Risk?The five stories mentioned earlier aren’t rare exceptions. They’re warning signs. In crypto, people have been extorted, abducted, and in some cases, killed — not because they ran scams, but simply because they were visible and valuable.This space offers freedom, but that freedom comes with real-world threats. As crypto becomes more traceable and more mainstream, your personal security needs to evolve just as fast.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Offline-First JavaScript for Space Missions: How JS Thrives in Low-Connectivity Environments</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/offline-first-javascript-for-space-missions-how-js-thrives-in-low-connectivity-environments?source=rss</link><author>Raju Dandigam</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 08:35:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Whenever we think about javascript we imagine websites, web applications, browser based games but javascript has quietly evolved beyond the web.Today, it's even orbiting our planet—and in some cases, headed to Mars. In environments where internet connectivity is a luxury, JavaScript is proving its worth as an offline-first language.This article explores how JavaScript is used in space missions, the challenges it solves in remote environments, and how developers can draw inspiration from these high-stakes use cases to build more resilient apps.Now, let’s understand why offline-first is important in Space?There are Spacecraft, satellites, and interplanetary rovers operate in extreme conditions: (up to 40 minutes delay betweenEarth and Mars)Power and memory constraintsNow, any of the software running in these systems must beResilient to connection dropsCapable of local decision-makingAble to sync data when possibleIn such a scenario, JavaScript’s lightweight nature, ecosystem, and offline-capable design patterns make it surprisingly useful.Let’s talk about some real use case of the space flow,Real Use Case: NASA's Open MCTOne of the most prominent JavaScript-based tools in space exploration is (Mission Control Technologies), developed by NASA.Now let’s understand what is that?A web-based platform for mission planning, telemetry visualization, and data monitoring.Built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.Designed to work offline, allowing ground operators to continue monitoring spacecraft without internet access.NASA's Ames Research CenterESA (European Space Agency)Commercial space startupsIts modular design allows teams to customize the interface and logic for specific missions—whether you're watching a Mars orbiter or a CubeSat in low Earth orbit.Now, let’s understand why we are using JS in space?Why Use JavaScript in Space?We all have wondered why they chose JS instead of C/C++ in the tech space?Fast prototyping for dashboards and tooling.Runs in browsers and Node.js environments.Use existing libraries to handle logs, charts, caching, etc.Service workers, IndexedDB, and localStorage**.**While low-level systems in spacecraft often use C or Ada, mission control tools, simulators, and dashboards are increasingly JS-powered.Here is the quick comparison with C with JS:|  |  |  |
|----|----|----|
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Slower, requires more setup |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |Can you tell me what techniques can be use in space?So, there are many techniques they can use in space but we will mainly focus on 5 techniques.Offline-First JS Techniques for SpaceService Workers for CachingLet’s understand what is that?Service workers allow caching files and API responses for offline access.self.addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {
  event.respondWith(
    caches.match(event.request).then((response) => {
      return response || fetch(event.request);
    })
  );
});
Perfect for telemetry dashboards where continuous internet isn’t guaranteed.\
Now, let’s see how offline data logging is doing in JS.Intermittent Sync StrategiesHey What’s this Intermittent sync strategy?let me explain to you about it so we all know that Space has very limited communication ways correct? Now in this case there are some strategies which can help here so that delta sync, data compression, and edge caching can reduce the time spent transferring data once a connection is re-established and it’s very crucial for high-latency environments like deep space.3. Fault Tolerance and RedundancySpace systems must anticipate failures. JavaScript applications can:
Use  for failed API calls.Implement  to prevent system overloads.Use  to maintain a record of all changes, allowing recovery after failures.4. Data Prioritization and CompressionNot all data is equally important. JS systems can prioritize critical telemetry and compress non-essential data to ensure the most important information reaches mission control.// Example: Compressing JSON data before sending
const data = { status: 'OK', battery: '85%', signal: 'strong' };
const compressed = JSON.stringify(data).replace(/\s+/g, '');
This approach minimizes data size, reducing transmission costs and time.When bandwidth is limited, not all data is equal. Systems tag and queue data by priority:Life-support > scientific readings > diagnosticsHigh-priority packets are synced firstJavascript on Edge Devices in SpaceIn Space missions often include sensors or edge devices with low computing power. Surprisingly, JS fits here too:Node.js on Raspberry Pi Zero (used in CubeSats)JavaScript runtimes on microcontrollers (e.g., Espruino, Moddable)Buffering telemetry for future sync A Raspberry Pi in a weather balloon logs atmospheric data with a Node.js app, stores readings in IndexedDB, and dumps to SD card for later analysis.Lessons Earth Developers Can LearnOffline-first JS isn't just for space—it benefits any environment with unreliable internet:Games with offline progress trackingIf it works on Mars, it'll work anywhere.Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)Caching and sync patternsThese ideas improve reliability, performance, and UX—whether you're in orbit or on a bus
The development of JavaScript from web page scripting to space mission technology represents an impressive transformation. The language demonstrates its growth and adaptability through this development. The study of JS operations in space enables us to develop applications that handle unpredictable conditions while delivering user satisfaction and creating a more resilient web and beyond.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Educational Byte: How to Buy Crypto for the First Time</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/educational-byte-how-to-buy-crypto-for-the-first-time?source=rss</link><author>Obyte</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 08:34:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[New to crypto? Want to know what the fuss is about? Well, it’s easier than you think. If you barely know a thing about the industry, buying cryptocurrency for the first time might feel a bit like learning a new language or stepping into a sci-fi movie, but don’t worry, you’re not alone. In fact, over 400 million people around the world now own crypto, and that number keeps growing.Crypto is digital money that doesn’t need banks or governments and works 24/7 from a simple app on your device (desktop, mobile, or other hardware). You can send it worldwide, without limits, and, depending on the decentralization level of the coin involved, no one, not even your government, can stop your transactions or seize your funds. Let’s see some other things you should know to start.Before you buy your first crypto, there are a few things you need to consider. Not to scare you, but to help you avoid headaches later. First off, yes,  in most countries, and yes, it’s real money with real market value. People all over the world use it for trading, sending money abroad, and even saving. But it’s not like putting cash under your mattress or buying a stock and forgetting about it. Depending on the coin, prices can jump or crash in hours. You should never invest more than you’re willing to lose.And please, don’t just trust anyone who talks a good game. Your favorite influencer? They might be getting paid to promote something shady. That random message on Telegram promising a 200% return? Probably . Even friends can get tricked and drag you into it without meaning to. If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Always double-check, read reviews, and compare sources.Also, think about why you’re doing this. Are you curious? Want to invest a bit? Planning to send money abroad? Different goals might lead you to different coins. Bitcoin, Ethereum, , stablecoins, , DeFi tokens —they all work differently and offer different things. Bitcoin and stablecoins mainly work for payments (stablecoins being more, well, stable in price). Ethereum and Obyte have smart contracts and other advanced features. Privacy tokens like Monero or  will obscure your transactions. DeFi tokens may help you make . It's really up to you, so do your research on the project you’re interested in first.Buying Crypto for the First TimeAfter you do your own research (), you’ll only need your phone or device of choice, pen and paper, Internet, and an email. Your ID may be required too, if you choose the easiest way to buy (through regulated companies). Overall, here are some simple steps to get started:\Choose your first crypto: This decision must be based on what you want to use it for, and not just what’s trending. Want to send money? Any crypto will do, especially stablecoins. Curious about Dapps? Look into Ethereum or Obyte. It’s also advisable to start small. \n Pick a trustworthy and/or regulated crypto exchange: If you only have fiat money (USD, EUR, etc.), you’ll need to visit a crypto exchange. They’re websites, mostly beginner-friendly, where you can create an account with an email and password, and start buying crypto with fiat. They may ask for your real ID, but again, that depends on the volume you want to handle. Popular exchanges include Binance, Coinbase, and Biconomy.As a side note: yes, you can also buy crypto directly from someone else. No need for middlemen. However, if you pick this option, be sure to select someone reliable. Crypto transactions can’t be reversed. Buying crypto physically from strangers, using cash, could be particularly dangerous.Make the purchase and store it safely: crypto exchanges may work as wallets, but they’re not wallets at all. While your money is there, it’s still controlled by the exchange, and if it goes under, so does your money. The best option is to select a  (under your full control), install it on your device of choice, and write down your private keys physically. Then, move most of your crypto funds to this wallet, and leave little or nothing in the exchange.The Obyte wallet has an easy option for learners: “,” available in the “Receive” menu. This button leads to a beginner-friendly website where it’s possible to  (Obyte’s native currency) and other Obyte-compatible tokens with ether (ETH), USD Coin (USDC) or Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC). All of them can be acquired with fiat in popular crypto exchanges.\ In case you only have fiat and you want to carry out the process from a single place, GBYTE is listed on the crypto exchange Biconomy against Tether (USDT).** Biconomy has  to buy stablecoins like USDT with payment methods like debit and credit cards, Banxa, Apple Pay, and Alchemy Pay. Once you’ve bought some USDT, you can exchange it for GBYTE on the same platform. Afterward, remember that those GBYTEs are on the Polygon network, so, if you want to use them in Obyte, you’ll need to import them through the .There’s another option as well: . This exchange doesn’t handle fiat, but it doesn’t ask for ID verification (KYC) either. They have the trading pairs GBYTE/BTC and GBYTE/USDT available. This is likely not the most beginner-friendly alternative, but if you’re concerned about your privacy, it may be the best path. Featured Vector Image by storyset / ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How I Built an AI to Beat the 1990s Arcade Game Double Dragon - DevConf.CZ 2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut1FdvvPxrs</link><author>DevConf</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ut1FdvvPxrs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 08:20:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmYAQDZIQGm_kPvemBc_qwg">Podcast - DevConfs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Speaker(s): Christopher Nuland

It’s time for Day 2 Ops in the world of AI.

Building enterprise-ready AI poses challenges around data security,scalability, and integration, especially in compliance-regulated industries. Firms are increasing efforts to mitigate risks associated with LLMs regarding sensitive data exfiltration of personally identifiable information and sensitive company data. The primary mitigation strategy is to build guardrails around Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to safeguard data while also optimizing query response quality and efficiency. 

To enable precise guardrails, one must implement permissions systems with advanced fine grained authorization capabilities such as returning lists of authorized subjects and accessible resources. Such systems ensure that LLMs can access only authorized data while preventing exfiltration of sensitive information, making RAGs more efficient and improving performance at scale. 

This session will cover how modern permissions systems can safeguard sensitive data in RAG pipelines. We'll start with why Authorization is critical for RAG pipelines to protect sensitive data from potential vulnerabilities and also the various techniques for permissions-aware data retrieval. The talk will also include a practical demo implementing fine-grained authorization for RAG using Pinecone, Langchain, OpenAI, and SpiceDB - an Open Source authorization database.

So, you’ve got a new colleague: an AI agent. It doesn’t need coffee breaks, doesn’t complain about on-call schedules, and (so it claims) can debug faster than you. Sounds perfect, right? Well, until it starts spamming Slack at 3 AM or, worse, decides it has production access opinions.

In this session, we’ll dive into the chaotic, glorious reality of managing AI agents as part of your SRE team. We’ll tackle the tough questions: How do you assign permissions to something that thinks it’s always right? How do you monitor and log what your robot coworker is doing (and why it thought deleting all your service accounts was a good idea)? And most importantly, how do you keep it from going rogue and bringing down prod on a Friday night?

With a mix of traditional SRE practices and new strategies tailored for AI agents, we’ll explore how to establish trust, maintain control, and avoid turning your AI into an unmanageable production liability. By the end of this talk, you’ll have the tools to SRE your AI colleague—because we all know it’s not a real teammate until it’s on-call with you.

The current process of identifying the root cause of a package build failure in Copr or Koji is time-consuming and requires considerable expertise. Log Detective proposes an automated log analysis system to help diagnose such failures and assist maintainers.

Log Detective uses Template Mining and Large Language Models to process your log files. It’s very simple to use, just go to https://logdetective.com/explain, paste a link to your log file, wait one minute and the service will explain that log to you.

Existing models like granite, llama, or mistral can give good feedback on your logs, but they don't understand our specific ecosystem. We are collecting log annotations to train our own models under the CDLA-Permissive-2.0 license. Our aim is to create a service that provides near-perfect explanations and solutions, as if an experienced maintainer was guiding you.

In this talk, we’ll give you an overview of Log Detective, explain the technical decisions and finish with a demo. You shouldn’t miss this talk if you are building software as your job.

Our team maintains a large-scale codebase for detecting and predicting issues in clusters, with hundreds of validation rules contributed and regularly updated by SRE engineers. A key challenge is identifying false positives and predicting which validations are most likely to require fixes.

In this research, we analyze validation rules as repeated code patterns, creating a unique dataset for machine learning. We compute numerical descriptors—such as code length, complexity, entropy, and time since introduction—across different Git branches and compare them with historical bug fixes. Preliminary results indicate strong correlations between these factors and validation reliability.

In this talk, we will present our findings using classical machine learning models and benchmark them against modern large language models (LLMs). We will discuss the effectiveness of both approaches, and the potential impact on automated validation quality improvement.

The Linux kernel RTNL mutex is the big lock protecting all of the internal kernel data structures related to networking. While there is work underway in the upstream community to reduce its scope, today this mutex is a major source of scalability problems in the kernel networking subsystem. It mostly affects control path operations (such as bringing network interfaces up and down), but unless care is taken to avoid it, RTNL lock issues can also spill over into the data path, causing intermittent stalls in networking applications that can be
hard to debug.

In this talk I will dive into techniques for debugging applications stalls caused by contention on the RTNL lock, using an example application that is derived from a real-world case. We will look at kernel tracing tools that can be used to identify and debug such issues, and talk about ways to mitigate them in the application. I will also briefly outline the upstream efforts to reduce the scope of the RTNL in the kernel, and how this will affect systems going forward.

Quantum computers look to eventually break all our existing public key algorithms. NIST has creates new replacement algorithms for key exchange and signatures. These new algorithms include new primitives like Key Encryption Mechanisms (KEMS) that can be built from either Key Exchange Algorithms (KEX) or Key Encryption Algorithms (KEA). Signatures now include primitives that require the signature before the hash verification starts. This talk walks through these new ideas, now PKCS #11 handles them and how they new algorithms actually work.

Keylime is a TPM-based remote attestation framework that originally relied on a pull model, where the verifier initiated attestation requests to monitored systems. However, this approach posed challenges for edge and IoT environments, where devices often operate with constrained resources and behind firewalls.

In this talk, we’ll dive into the transition from a pull-based model to a push-based (agent-driven) attestation model, where the agent on the monitored system actively pushes integrity measurements to the verifier. We’ll explore the architectural changes, the technical challenges we tackled, and how this shift makes remote attestation more practical for edge, cloud, and IoT deployments.

Additionally, we’ll highlight how this work was made possible through open-source collaboration, showcasing not only the technical advancements in Keylime but also the power of open-source development in solving real-world security challenges.

This presentation explores a novel approach to passwordless authentication in Gnome, leveraging the power of [SSSD](https://sssd.io/) and a newly developed extension to the Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) conversation. We introduce a JSON-based messaging system that significantly enriches the communication between PAM modules and client applications, enabling sophisticated authentication flows. This enhanced communication facilitates contextual information sharing, adaptive authentication, and seamless multi-factor authentication, all within the familiar GNOME desktop environment.
The talk delves into the technical details of this JSON-based interface between SSSD and [GDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Display_Manager), providing insights into its [design](https://github.com/SSSD/sssd.io/pull/79) and implementation. Furthermore, a simple PAM rust application will be presented as a practical example, serving as a reference for developers seeking to integrate this protocol into their own PAM applications. This opens up a wide range of possibilities for enhanced authentication flows, including:

* **Contextual information**: sharing user-specific data or authentication challenges.
* **Adaptive authentication**: dynamically adjusting authentication steps.
* **Multi-Factor authentication**: orchestrating complex authentication sequences.

The presentation will conclude with live demonstrations showcasing the capabilities of this extended PAM conversation and its potential for innovation in authentication systems.
We will also share the current development status and preliminary GUI designs, subject to ongoing development progress.

Large Language Models (LLM) require preprocessing vast amounts of data, a process that can span days due to its complexity and scale, often involving PetaBytes of data. This talk demonstrates how Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP) simplify LLM data processing with flexibility, repeatability, and scalability. These pipelines are being used daily at IBM Research to build indemnified LLMs tailored for enterprise applications.
Different data preparation toolkits are built on Kubernetes, Rust, Slurm, or Spark. How would you choose one for your own LLM experiments or enterprise use cases and why should you consider Kubernetes and KFP?
This talk describes how open source Data Prep Toolkit leverages KFP and KubeRay for scalable pipeline orchestration, e.g. deduplication, content classification, and tokenization.
We share challenges, lessons, and insights from our experience with KFP, highlighting its applicability for diverse LLM tasks, such as data preprocessing, RAG retrieval, and model fine-tuning.

Vulnerability discovery is one of the crucial aspects of software supply chain security. We want to know which of the components in our software projects are affected by certain vulnerabilities, are they exploitable and how severe exploits are.

Organizations take different approaches to this topic, from using commercial software scanners to embedding SSCS practices early in their development process and preventing the usage and release of vulnerable projects.

In this session we will look behind the scene of software vulnerability management. Where is all the data coming from? What are the formats in which data is exchanged? We will dig into the world of CVEs and VEXs (Vulnerability exchange) and show how efforts like the OSV (Open Source Vulnerability) database help us keep safe. We discuss some of the challenges of living in this multi-truth world.

In the end we will demo how project Trustify (https://github.com/trustification/trustify/) collects and analyses all this data, in order to provide up to date vulnerability information for your SBOMs.

The core reason? Ethical unease.The research surveyed 78 organizations and conducted in-depth interviews with 21 fundraising professionals. While participants acknowledged that AI could streamline operations and enhance engagement, many remained wary of its risks — particularly around , transparency, and tool reliability.Dr. Marta Herrero, the report’s lead researcher and Director at CDIPF, emphasized the gap between technical potential and emotional readiness. “AI-driven technology is capable of offering novel and compelling possibilities for charitable fundraising,” she said. “However, first we need to build trust among fundraising professionals.”Herrero stressed the importance of fundraisers understanding both the benefits and limitations of AI. Beyond technical training, she said, the profession needs cultural readiness — confidence in using the tools responsibly and ethically.The report was formally launched at the CIOF’s annual Fundraising Convention, under the theme Shaping the Future of Fundraising with AI.Ceri Edwards, executive director of engagement at CIOF, reinforced the message: “As AI technologies become increasingly accessible, they offer unparalleled opportunities for our sector — however, we must navigate these advancements carefully.”She added that ethical clarity and donor trust must remain at the center of AI integration efforts.This study adds to a growing body of global concern around the unchecked use of AI in sensitive sectors. For fundraisers, whose work is built on human connection and trust, the path to AI adoption may require more than just innovation — it needs ethical alignment.What’s at Stake for the Nonprofit SectorUnlike in commercial marketing, where rapid adoption of AI can offer immediate ROI, nonprofits face a different calculation. Here, missteps come with reputational risk. A botched AI rollout that mishandles donor data or personalizes outreach poorly could backfire, harming both donations and community trust.Imagine a donor receiving an automated message suggesting a gift based on income data they never consented to share — the loss of goodwill could outweigh any automation gain.At the same time, fundraising teams are increasingly resource-constrained. AI offers efficiency: chatbots to triage queries, models to prioritize donor outreach, even predictive tools to forecast campaign performance. But until ethical concerns are addressed head-on, those benefits may remain out of reach.“We want fundraisers to feel confident about using AI,” said Dr. Herrero, “feeling that they understand what it can do well, the challenges it poses, and — most importantly — that they trust in their own abilities to identify how they can use the tools responsibly for the benefit of the communities and donors they serve.”That balance of empowerment and ethical literacy may be the missing piece in the sector’s cautious approach.Where It Could Go From HereFundraising won’t escape AI — but it may humanize it first. Unlike sales-driven sectors, nonprofits are demanding trust by design, not as an afterthought. Expect to see hybrid models emerge, where AI supports but never replaces human judgment. The organizations that get this balance right could not only raise more, but also raise better.Should nonprofits slow down AI adoption until ethical frameworks are stronger — or risk falling behind? Tell us what you think.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI Agents Can Now Pay Autonomously Thanks to x402 and HTTP 402</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/ai-agents-can-now-pay-autonomously-thanks-to-x402-and-http-402?source=rss</link><author>Stefano Amorelli</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 07:52:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The specification introduces  : previously, every single HTTP request required a fresh TCP connection. Persistent connections resolve this, allowing multiple HTTP requests to flow through a single, long-lived TCP connection. No more establishing separate connections for every image, CSS file, or JavaScript snippet on a web page.There's also chunked transfer encoding , a new way for web servers to stream content without knowing the full size beforehand. No longer does a server need to calculate the total size of dynamically generated content upfront, it's now free to deliver data incrementally, as it's produced.But RFC 2068 quietly introduces something intriguing , a new status code:HTTP 402 Payment Required
This code is reserved for future use.
This shows how the founding fathers of world wide web predicted how money would eventually become a big part of internet, even if they had no clear path on how it would actually play out.Today, 2025, nearly three decades and multiple HTTP versions later ( in 2015,  in 2022), still sits there with the exact same note: 'reserved for future use.' Despite the fintech revolution, the rise of online payments, and an entire economy built on internet transactions, nobody had figured out what to do with it.Last month (May 2025), Coinbase released , an open source protocol that gives  its first real job: enabling native  payments within HTTP requests.Nowadays AI agents need to make  (machine-to-machine) payments across the web with reduced  (human-in-the-loop) interventions, but traditional payment flows dont work well in this case. They require multiple human interactions, redirects, and manual steps that simply don't work when an AI agent needs to make a transaction autonomously. fills this gap. It proposes an automated on-chain payment flow implemented natively within the HTTP protocol, making them as seamless as any other web request.But what does this look like in practice? is built around four core components:A  acts as the payment initiator, discovering what's required for access and constructing the appropriate payment payload. Put simply, this is whatever is making the HTTP request to a pay-walled resource. It could be a browser making a request for premium content, an AI agent purchasing API access, or a mobile app unlocking features. The client handles the cryptographic signing using the user's private key and automatically retries requests when payment is required.The  enforces payment policies for its endpoints while remaining focused on its core business logic. This is the web server or API that hosts the content or service being purchased. It maintains simple pricing tables that map endpoints to costs, but delegates the payment verification logic to the facilitator.Blockchain logic is implemented in the  component: verifying cryptographic signatures, preventing replay attacks through nonce tracking, and managing the actual on-chain settlement. It allows both clients and servers to work with on-chain payments without understanding the blockchain implementation details.On  resides the final settlement layer, ensuring payments are immutable and transparent. It enables programmable money through smart contracts and stable-coins, but its complexity is completely hidden from the application layer by the facilitator.Primary Responsibility: Payment initiationKey Features:EIP-712 signing, automatic retries, payment discoveryWhat it does: Makes requests, handles wallets, retries with paymentPrimary Responsibility: Payment enforcementKey Features: Pricing tables, HTTP 402 responses, middleware integrationWhat it does: Sets prices, checks payments, serves contentPrimary Responsibility: Payment verificationKey Features: Signature verification, nonce tracking, gas abstractionWhat it does: Verifies signatures, talks to blockchainPrimary Responsibility: Payment settlementKey Features:USDC transfers, smart contracts, immutable recordsWhat it does: Settles payments on chainThis architecture demonstrates several fundamental software engineering principles. The most important is . Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility. Resource servers focus purely on business logic, facilitators handle payment complexity, and clients manage user interaction.The system achieves  by having components interact only through standardized HTTP and REST interfaces. A resource server doesn't need to understand how blockchain transactions work, and a client doesn't need to know the server's internal implementation. This isolation means you can swap out components (for example, use a different blockchain, change facilitator providers, or modify server logic) without affecting the rest of the system.The facilitator embodies the single responsibility principle by isolating all blockchain complexity into one specialized service. This prevents payment logic from leaking into business applications and keeps concerns properly separated.Last but not least this architecture follows . High-level components depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations. Servers and clients depend on HTTP interfaces, not specific blockchain APIs. This allows the same application code to work across different blockchains and payment schemes without modification.When an AI agent or user hits an -enabled API, here's the four-step flow that happens: : The client makes a standard HTTP request to access some resourcePayment required response : If no payment is attached, the server responds with  and includes payment details : The client creates a cryptographically signed payment and retries the request : The server validates the payment, broadcasts it to the blockchain, and grants accessWhat makes this powerful is that it all happens at the HTTP protocol level. No redirects to third-party payment processors, no  flows, no account creation. Just standard HTTP with extra headers: flows from client to server and contains the . This includes the payment details (amount, recipient, token) plus a cryptographic signature proving the client authorized the payment. flows from server to client after successful payment and contains transaction receipt information , providing transparency about what happened on-chain.Server-side implementationPayment middleware architectureThe core server-side implementation revolves around a payment filter (AKA middle-ware) that intercepts HTTP requests and enforces payment requirements. When integrated into your web server, this middle-ware checks incoming requests against a price table that maps endpoints to their costs.The middle-ware follows a simple decision tree: if a request hits a protected endpoint without payment, it responds with  and detailed payment instructions. If payment is included in the  header, it verifies the payment with a facilitator service before allowing the request to proceed.Here's the essential structure from the Java implementation:public class PaymentFilter implements Filter {
    private final String payTo;
    private final Map<String, BigInteger> priceTable; // path → amount
    private final FacilitatorClient facilitator;

    public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, 
                        FilterChain chain) throws IOException, ServletException {
        String path = req.getRequestURI();
        String paymentHeader = req.getHeader("X-PAYMENT");

        if (!priceTable.containsKey(path)) {
            chain.doFilter(request, response);  // Free endpoint
            return;
        }

        if (paymentHeader == null) {
            send402Response(resp, path);  // Request payment
            return;
        }

        // Verify payment, process request, then settle
        VerificationResponse verification = facilitator.verify(paymentHeader, requirements);
        if (verification.valid) {
            chain.doFilter(request, response);
            facilitator.settle(paymentHeader, requirements);
        }
    }
}
The beauty of this approach is that it requires minimal changes to existing applications. You simply add the payment filter to your middle-ware stack and define which endpoints require payment. ResponseWhen a client hits a protected endpoint without payment, the server constructs a detailed payment requirements object. This includes the payment amount, accepted tokens (like ), the receiving wallet address, blockchain network, and an expiration time to prevent replay attacks.private void send402Response(HttpServletResponse response, String path) throws IOException {
    response.setStatus(HttpStatus.PAYMENT_REQUIRED);
    response.setContentType("application/json");

    PaymentRequirements requirements = PaymentRequirements.builder()
        .paymentRequirement(List.of(
            PaymentRequirement.builder()
                .kind(new Kind("exact", "base-sepolia"))             // Payment scheme + blockchain network
                .receiver(payTo)                                     // Wallet address to receive payment
                .amount(priceTable.get(path))                        // Cost for this specific endpoint
                .asset("<USDC_TOKEN_CONTRACT>")                      // USDC token contract
                .expiry(Instant.now().plus(Duration.ofMinutes(5)))   // Payment window
                .nonce(UUID.randomUUID().toString())                 // One-time use identifier
                .build()
        ))
        .build();

    response.getWriter().write(Json.MAPPER.writeValueAsString(requirements));
}
Each field in the  is described as follows:: Defines the payment scheme ( for fixed amounts) and target blockchain network ( for Base testnet). This tells the client exactly how to structure and execute the payment.: The wallet address where payment should be sent. This is your business wallet that will receive the funds.: The cost for accessing this specific endpoint, retrieved from your price table. For USDC, this is typically expressed in  (smallest unit).: The smart contract address of the token to be used for payment. The example shows USDC on Base Sepolia testnet.: A timestamp after which this payment requirement becomes invalid. This prevents old payment requests from being reused and adds security against replay attacks.: A unique identifier (UUID) that ensures each payment requirement can only be fulfilled once, even if the same client makes multiple requests to the same endpoint.Client-side implementationAutomatic payment handlingClient libraries wrap standard HTTP clients to automatically handle 402 responses. When a client receives a payment requirement, (1) it constructs a payment payload, (2) signs it with the user's private key, and (3) retries the original request with the payment attached.public HttpResponse<String> makeRequest(String url, String method) throws Exception {
    HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
        .uri(URI.create(url))
        .method(method, HttpRequest.BodyPublishers.noBody())
        .build();

    HttpResponse<String> response = httpClient.send(request, 
        HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());

    // Handle 402 Payment Required
    if (response.statusCode() == 402) {
        PaymentRequirements requirements = Json.MAPPER.readValue(
            response.body(), PaymentRequirements.class);

        // Create payment payload matching the requirements
        PaymentPayload payment = PaymentPayload.builder()
            .receiver(requirements.getPaymentRequirement().get(0).getReceiver())
            .amount(requirements.getPaymentRequirement().get(0).getAmount())
            .asset(requirements.getPaymentRequirement().get(0).getAsset())
            .nonce(requirements.getPaymentRequirement().get(0).getNonce())
            .expiry(requirements.getPaymentRequirement().get(0).getExpiry())
            .build();

        // Sign using EIP-712 structured data signing
        String signature = signer.sign(payment.toSigningMap());

        // Retry with payment header
        String paymentHeader = encodePaymentHeader(payment, signature);
        HttpRequest paidRequest = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
            .uri(URI.create(url))
            .method(method, HttpRequest.BodyPublishers.noBody())
            .header("X-PAYMENT", paymentHeader)
            .build();

        return httpClient.send(paidRequest, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
    }

    return response;
}
The signing process uses the  standard, which creates a structured, human-readable representation of the payment data before hashing and signing it. This ensures the payment is cryptographically secure and tied to the specific request.Payment verification flowThe facilitator service is where the blockchain complexity lives, abstracting it away from both clients and servers. When a server receives a payment, it forwards the payment payload to the facilitator for verification.public class HttpFacilitatorClient implements FacilitatorClient {
    private final HttpClient http;
    private final String baseUrl;

    @Override
    public VerificationResponse verify(String paymentHeader, PaymentRequirements requirements) 
        throws Exception {

        // Construct verification request with payment and requirements
        VerifyRequest body = VerifyRequest.builder()
            .paymentHeader(paymentHeader)     // The X-PAYMENT header from client
            .requirements(requirements)       // What the server expects
            .build();

        HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
            .uri(URI.create(baseUrl + "/verify"))
            .POST(HttpRequest.BodyPublishers.ofString(Json.MAPPER.writeValueAsString(body)))
            .header("Content-Type", "application/json")
            .build();

        String json = http.send(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString()).body();
        return Json.MAPPER.readValue(json, VerificationResponse.class);
    }

    @Override
    public SettlementResponse settle(String paymentHeader, PaymentRequirements requirements) 
        throws Exception {

        // Settlement happens after successful verification
        SettleRequest body = SettleRequest.builder()
            .paymentHeader(paymentHeader)
            .requirements(requirements)
            .build();

        HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
            .uri(URI.create(baseUrl + "/settle"))
            .POST(HttpRequest.BodyPublishers.ofString(Json.MAPPER.writeValueAsString(body)))
            .header("Content-Type", "application/json")
            .build();

        String json = http.send(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString()).body();
        return Json.MAPPER.readValue(json, SettlementResponse.class);
    }
}
The facilitator checks several things:Does the payment amount match the requirements?Has this payment been used before?Is the payment still within its expiration window?If verification passes, the facilitator also handles settlement by broadcasting the transaction to the blockchain of choice. The  interface defines the contract that any facilitator client must implement:public interface FacilitatorClient {
    VerificationResponse verify(String paymentHeader, PaymentRequirements requirements);
    SettlementResponse settle(String paymentHeader, PaymentRequirements requirements);
}
Your application needs to provide a concrete implementation of this interface.Now that we've seen the individual components (payment filters, facilitator integration, and client handling) let's look at how these pieces come together in a real application. Here's a minimal  example that demonstrates the complete flow.First, create a  annotation:@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
public @interface PaymentRequired {
    String price();
    String currency() default "USDC";
    String network() default "base-sepolia";
}
Then modify the  to scan for these annotations at startup:@Component
public class PaymentFilter implements Filter {
    private final Map<String, BigInteger> priceTable;
    private final String payTo;
    private final FacilitatorClient facilitator;

    public PaymentFilter(ApplicationContext context, String payTo, FacilitatorClient facilitator) {
        this.payTo = payTo;
        this.facilitator = facilitator;
        this.priceTable = buildPriceTableFromAnnotations(context);
    }

    private Map<String, BigInteger> buildPriceTableFromAnnotations(ApplicationContext context) {
        Map<String, BigInteger> prices = new HashMap<>();

        // Scan all @RestController beans for @PaymentRequired annotations
        Map<String, Object> controllers = context.getBeansWithAnnotation(RestController.class);

        for (Object controller : controllers.values()) {
            Method[] methods = controller.getClass().getMethods();
            for (Method method : methods) {
                PaymentRequired payment = method.getAnnotation(PaymentRequired.class);
                if (payment != null) {
                    String path = extractPathFromMapping(method);
                    BigInteger amount = new BigInteger(payment.price().replace(".", ""));
                    prices.put(path, amount);
                }
            }
        }
        return prices;
    }
}
Now you can annotate your controller methods directly:@RestController
public class WeatherController {

    @GetMapping("/weather")
    @PaymentRequired(price = "0.001", currency = "USDC", network = "base-sepolia")
    public WeatherData getWeather(@RequestParam String city) {
        // Your existing business logic
        return weatherService.getWeatherForCity(city);
    }

    @GetMapping("/premium-forecast")
    @PaymentRequired(price = "0.01", currency = "USDC", network = "base-sepolia")
    public ExtendedForecast getPremiumForecast(@RequestParam String city) {
        return weatherService.getExtendedForecast(city);
    }
}

@Configuration
public class PaymentConfig {

    @Bean
    public PaymentFilter paymentFilter(ApplicationContext context) {
        return new PaymentFilter(
            context,
            "<WALLET_ADDRESS>", // Your wallet address
            new HttpFacilitatorClient("<FACILITATOR_URL>")
        );
    }

    @Bean
    public FilterRegistrationBean<PaymentFilter> paymentFilterRegistration(PaymentFilter filter) {
        FilterRegistrationBean<PaymentFilter> registration = new FilterRegistrationBean<>();
        registration.setFilter(filter);
        registration.addUrlPatterns("/*");
        registration.setOrder(1);
        return registration;
    }
}
The  annotation handles pricing configuration declaratively, while the  automatically discovers these annotations at startup and builds the price table. Your existing business logic in the controller methods remains completely unchanged. The configuration wires everything together by registering the payment filter and connecting it to a facilitator service. Once deployed, requests to  cost 0.001 USDC and  costs 0.01 USDC, with all payment handling happening transparently at the HTTP layer.Security and production considerations is simple and elegant, it hides complexity. This is a pro and a con. It makes integration easy, but it also hides an important aspect: putting AI agents in charge of money creates new attack vectors.While  signatures and nonce management handle replay attacks, what happens when an agent gets compromised? Traditional fraud detection relies on human behavioral patterns, but AI agents don't follow human spending habits. A compromised agent could drain funds faster than any human fraudster.The facilitator component becomes another high-value target since it's verifying signatures and managing nonces. Unlike traditional payment processors that can reverse transactions, blockchain settlements are final.Since  is based on on-chain transactions, it inherits the operational risks of blockchain transactions. Gas fees fluctuate wildly, sometimes making micropayments economically inconvenient. Network congestion can delay transactions. What's an AI agent supposed to do when it needs real-time data but the payment is stuck in a mempool?Another important aspect is regulation. Compliance varies across jurisdictions with different rules about automated payments, cryptocurrency usage, and data retention. An AI agent making a large volume of micro-transactions across borders might trigger AML alerts or violate local regulations without anyone realizing it.What's interesting about  is the timing. AI agents need autonomous payment capabilities, stablecoins provide a programmable money layer, and blockchain infrastructure has matured enough to handle scalable applications. These pieces haven't aligned before. Internet now needs a new form of payments, and traditional flows weren't built for autonomous agents or micropayments. is compelling thanks to its pragmatic approach. Instead of reinventing payments from scratch, it extends existing HTTP infrastructure. Instead of requiring new integrations, it works with standard patterns that we already understand.The security and operational challenges are real, but they're engineering problems with possible solutions.After nearly three decades,  might finally do what it was designed for: make paying for things on the internet as simple as requesting them.The foundation is set. Now it's time to build.Resources and Further Reading]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Invisible Filters in Power BI? Here&apos;s the Deep Fix That Worked</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/invisible-filters-in-power-bi-heres-the-deep-fix-that-worked?source=rss</link><author>Grigory Koftaylov</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 07:49:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Long story short, once I found that a report I had previously created showed strange data. I can’t show you real visuals as they contain data I can’t disclose, so they are just blank in the article or are mocked. Please, imagine you are expecting to see a few hundred thousand but seeing only hundreds.\
All visible slicers were not set up, but the numbers were too low. Thankfully, the Filters feature helps us understand what filters are applied to the visual:The second filter is legitimate, so there is no problem there. But another one showed one value of the “National name” field. This filtration was applied to all visuals on the page. The is such a slicer on the page, however, it was not set up (it showed All), and the Filters pane showed this filter — so slicers have nothing to do with it. To prove this point, I removed all visuals from the list except the table — the filter was still applied.All suggestions I found while surfing the internet led to checking hidden slicers, which I had already done. It seems to me like a bug or glitch, which appeared somehow while I was editing other pages and the data model.One option is to rebuild the whole page from scratch or at least copy and paste all visuals onto a new page and set them up. However, there were many tricky interaction relationships between them, and this approach would require manual setup and is time-consuming. It would be a problem since there were four dozen visuals, and recreating the correct relationships would be a nightmare. Roughly 1500 clicks would be needed to change the size of visuals and their locations to be able to click on an interaction icon, and then return everything to its place. No, thanks. If there’s a chance to avoid that, I’ll take it.Attempts to delete or rename either the value or field did not help.So the only way left is to edit the internal files of the report.Well, here we come to the main point of the article. There are two parts. The first part will tell you how to get to internal files and a few things about their structure, if you never edit them probably you should read it first. The second part will provide the final short solution that worked well for me, so if you have some experience you can just jump to it.I suggest making a copy of your report to work with in case something goes wrong. If you work in the standard Windows Explorer, you might need to turn on “Show file extensions” in its settings.Rename the file, changing .pbix to .zip, and agree with the warning.Extract the files and go to the resulting folder.Here you can see the files in which Power BI stores all report data. For an explanation of these files, refer to this article.The file we are looking for is in the Report folder and is called Layout. You can use any app you prefer to navigate and edit it. Standard MS Notepad lacks advanced features, so I prefer Notepad++ for editing text files. It has syntax highlighting and different plugins. For working with JSON, I used JSONTools. If you know exactly what and where to edit, you might use just Notepad, but for the first time, it makes sense to use advanced tools.This is how it looks in plain text view. To improve readability, use the “Pretty-print current JSON file” function of the JSONTools plugin.If your file is well-structured but lacks syntax highlighting, you can add it by selecting Language -> JSON.Now it looks clearer, however, some of the values contain strings of JSON, so instead of a full tree, we see only one block.To see all data in a tree view, replace some symbols. Warning! The following actions will break the initial structure of the file and make it unusable for reassembling the Power BI report. Use this only for learning and investigation.It might be helpful to create a Macro in Notepad++ and save these actions for future use.After replacing, use the “Pretty-print current JSON file” of the JSONTools plugin again.Now it looks much better, and we can use it for exploration. For easier navigation, you can open the JSON Tree viewer from the JSONTools plugin. It looks similar to the Notepad view but shows the number of values for each key and data type.Now we can go deeper into the structure of the Layout file.The clause here is exactly what we have in the test report:If a visual has a filter set up through the Filter pane, we find the clause in the Filters value as well:This is some theory obtained from parsing the Layout file of a simple test report. It’s time to look at the Layout from the broken live report. Open the file, transform it for better exploration, and find the required filter in the data query block. Also, there is a non-empty Filter block, which filters by another field, so it’s valid.Now we understand the structure of the file and I can try to look at the initial untransformed file. The only way to find the places we are looking for is to search by names used in the report. Fortunately, we have the value of the problematic field. There were 3 dozen such places in the file. Here you can see the selected part of the Where clause with the problematic condition:Now we can delete the Condition section (in all clauses where they are met), or delete the whole Where section if there is only one condition. Notepad++ helps you to identify beginning and end brackets with highlights.After deleting, save the file. If you made a copy, move it to another folder — there should be only one Layout file in the Report folder.Now, there’s one last step which took me a lot of hours — if you skip it, your pbix report won’t open even if you made no mistakes editing the Layout file.You should delete the SecurityBindings file from the root folder of the report.According to the article mentioned earlier, this file contains Row-Level Security data. Keeping it before reassembling the report will prevent it from opening. Since I have no RLS in this report, it’s not a problem to delete it. At least, I haven’t found any issues in the report after doing so.Delete the SecurityBindings file and zip the report folder: select all files and folders, and send them to a Compressed (zipped) folder. Then change the extension back to .pbix and try to open it. If done correctly, your file will successfully open with Power BI Desktop, and you will find your report is fixed.If you get an error while opening the report, you might have made a mistake editing the files. Try to repeat all steps from scratch. You can make small changes step-by-step and check if there are errors after each step.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tech Leaders Need First Principles Thinking Now More Than Ever</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/tech-leaders-need-first-principles-thinking-now-more-than-ever?source=rss</link><author>Archith</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 07:47:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[You're a leader, more specifically, one that works with technology, engineering, or product development—if you're reading this. You're faced with hard problems every day. As easy as it is to simply leap headfirst into the tried and true, I've learned over the years that one of the most effective mental models is to step back and apply First Principles Thinking.What Exactly is First Principles Thinking?First principles thinking is literally just breaking down complicated problems into their basic, underlying facts and rebuilding solutions afresh from scratch. Instead of analogizing solutions from one's own background (or worse, copying competitors), this process forces you to question assumptions, drill down, and generate true innovation.Why Does This Matter in Tech?First, a reality check: tech leaders are perpetually under pressure. Pressure from stakeholders, competitors, or even our own aggressive timetables. Under constant pressure, it's all too easy to fall back on generic playbooks or industry "best practices."Here's the problem: best practices are average solutions to typical challenges. They will seldom provide breakthrough outcomes.By taking a step back and applying first principles, you'll be able to find new solutions. Like when you're scaling a platform, it's easy to rush in and just throw more infrastructure or conventional scaling techniques at the problem. But consider this, what's really the limitation here? Is it compute, is it latency, or maybe it's a suboptimal data architecture that's inherently broken?Practical Application: Scaling Without Blindly Adding CostsRecently, my team faced frenetic scaling problems after a product launch that led to excessive traffic. GUT reaction: give more AWS resources—everyone knows that's the easiest thing to do. However, I waited and wore first principles thinking instead:Pinpoint the root constraints: We plunged into performance metrics. Was the server load? Database contention? API inefficiencies?Challenge every assumption: We had initially presumed that we needed more resources. But was our data structure efficient enough? Were our caching techniques maximized? Were certain features too resource-intensive when they did not have to be?Rebuild the solution from fundamentals: We realized that the real problem wasn't server capacity; it was how often we cached and repeatedly called expensive database queries. By revisiting our caching strategy in its most basic form, we greatly reduced costs and improved performance.A helpful technique to help with first principles thinking application is the "Five Whys" technique, notoriously created by Toyota:Because the servers are overloaded.Why are the servers overloaded?Because there's too much traffic from repeated database calls.Why are there repeated database calls?Because the cache refreshes too often.Why does the cache refresh often?Because it is based on a badly made update interval choice.Why was this update interval choice made?Due to an old assumption about user behavior.By repeating "why" several times, we found the root cause and fixed the fundamental issue rather than giving a superficial solution.First Principles Framework for PracticeHere's a simple-to-use but effective framework that you can apply to practice first principles thinking: Clearly articulate what you're trying to solve. Define and break down the problem elements. Boldly challenge each element and assumption. Use the Five Whys or other methods to drill down to the root causes. Build new solutions from these absolute truths.Beyond Technical ProblemsFirst principles aren't exclusive to technology. They're also robust in leadership contexts—hiring, organizational structure, and even communication strategy.With a consistent drip of employee turnover, rather than showering employees with more benefits or bonuses, you wonder: Why are people actually quitting? Is it compensation, chances for growth, or perhaps lack of meaningful work?By cutting it down to first principles, you'll be more likely to find simpler, but better answers.Quick Tips to Practice First Principles ThinkingAttack assumptions aggressively: Assume nothing is holy. Drill deep to an anchor truth. If it looks too complex, you probably haven't cut it thinly enough.First principles thinking won't always be the simplest or fastest route—at first. But the clarity and imagination it provides are unmatchable. In a rapidly shifting tech world, that clarity isn't just worth its weight in gold; it's mandatory.Remember, average strategies have average results. The next time you find yourself faced with complexity, try applying first principles—it may very well change how you lead.What's your experience been with first principles thinking?

But for many freelancers, it becomes a minefield of scams, manipulation, and wasted time. Below, we bring you real titles and stories from actual freelancers who got burned — so you don’t have to.“I was invited to a voice recording job. The catch? The payment would be sent as a bonus after task completion. Turns out bonus payments aren’t protected if you haven’t worked with the client before. Upwork did nothing when the client vanished.”Lesson: Never accept jobs where payment is offered solely as a bonus. Use milestone or hourly contracts with tracked time to stay protected.“The client filed a chargeback after Upwork ruled in my favor during arbitration. Upwork took the money back anyway and locked my withdrawals.”Lesson: Even “won” disputes can go south. Learn how chargebacks work and avoid clients who seem to look for loopholes. If possible, prefer hourly contracts with work diaries.“After delivering the design files, the client went silent. Then they suddenly disputed the milestone and claimed I overbilled.”Lesson: Always send preview-only versions of your work until payment is received. Document all client approvals in messages.“Got a message offering a copywriting job. They sent a Telegram handle, then a shady form with personal questions and a bonus-based payment model.”✅ Lesson: Any job that pulls you off-platform early is usually a scam. Stay inside Upwork’s ecosystem until trust is built — and  give personal info outside contracts.“Not kidding. They wanted a urine test and a psychological profile. For a part-time remote assistant gig. Absolutely unhinged.”Lesson: You don’t owe anyone your bodily fluids. This is an extreme red flag. Decline and report such behavior immediately.“I submitted my ID and did a video call, but Upwork still banned me. I lost access to all my pending payments.”Lesson: Keep backups of everything: contracts, work files, and withdrawal receipts. Don’t rely 100% on a single platform — have an exit strategy.“Spent a ridiculous amount boosting proposals. Got ignored or ghosted. Some jobs looked real but never had any intention of hiring.”Lesson: Don’t assume more Connects = more chances. Look for red flags: clients with zero hires, vague descriptions, or ‘too good to be true’ budgets.“Initially it was one email. Then two. Then landing pages. All under the same milestone. I’m being squeezed dry.”Lesson: Scope creep is real. Define hard boundaries in your contract, and pause work the moment deliverables go beyond what was agreed.“Client didn’t leave feedback. But my JSS dropped immediately after. Did I just get silently punished?”Lesson: Clients can leave private feedback even if they say nothing publicly. Always aim to wrap projects with clear deliverables and satisfaction.“I was about to accept the contract, then noticed the client’s account was brand new. The next day it was suspended. I could’ve been trapped.”Lesson: Always check client history: hiring rate, reviews, and time on the platform. If it’s too new, it might be fake.These are not just stories — they are  from real people trying to earn a living. Every freelancer should:Protect deliverables until payment.Avoid off-platform communication.💬 “If it feels off, it probably is. You’re better off walking away than working for free.”Stay sharp out there. The freedom of freelancing is powerful — but only if you protect it.\

Let’s start with Github Co-pilot.As a frontend developer, my job involves building features, debugging, and constantly improving things across large codebases. Copilot has become a tool I rely on almost every day — not to do the work for me, but to help me start faster, move smarter, and catch things earlier.Today, I’m breaking down how I actually use GitHub Copilot inside PhpStorm — where it works , and where you still need to lead.What makes Copilot inside PhpStorm so useful is this:It understands the file, the code, and the project context.This means I can write a comment like:// Service to validate student assignment submissions
…and Copilot will generate a solid starting point — not just random boilerplate, but something relevant to the structure of my project.This kind of head start makes a huge difference when starting something from scratch. It saves me from staring at a blank file, remembering syntaxes and starting empty functions. Instead, I’m editing and evolving, which is much faster than writing from zero.But here’s the thing: You need a strong mental model of what you’re building before AI can be helpful.How I Use GitHub Copilot Daily Let me walk you through some real-life use cases that have made the most impact:Kickstarting new features I often create starter code for new features by prompting Copilot based on what the file or module is meant to do. It gives me a first draft, and from there, I build step-by-step toward the final version.It’s not about skipping thinking — it’s about saving time on repetitive scaffolding.Reusing patterns from past work A while ago, I experimented with dnd-kit to build a custom drag-and-drop interface. When I later needed to build sortable question lists for a live feature, I pointed Copilot to the earlier implementation.It recognized the logic and followed the same pattern — helping me repurpose tested ideas in seconds.That saved me hours of research and fiddling.Code reviews — before anyone else sees my PR One of my favorite ways to use Copilot is to run a pre-review on my code. I have a simple custom prompt that I use for this.It flags inconsistencies, suggests better naming, logic issues — even potential edge cases. It also suggests how I can improve accessibility and how the code can be more maintainable.This gives me confidence before sharing my work with the team. I treat it as my private reviewer.Debugging: Smarter logging suggestions Copilot can be a game-changer to help debug code. One great trick is asking:“Where should I put console logs to help you debug this error?”It often points me to helpful log spots. Then I run the app, collect logs, and ask Copilot what they mean.Sometimes this saves a lot of time. Sometimes… not so much. AI can go in circles — and you need to know when to stop and rely on your instincts.The Truth About AI-Generated Code Let me be clear:You can’t just accept what Copilot gives you.AI can hallucinate. It can suggest things that look right — but aren’t. If you don’t understand the micro-details of your system, it’ll slow you down.Using Copilot well requires skill. You have to guide it, check its work, and sometimes work around its wrong turns.But when you do — when you know how to prompt it smartly, use context, and course-correct — it makes you faster, not just lazier.Final Thoughts I didn’t learn this overnight. It came from trying, failing, and figuring out what works over the past year.But today, GitHub Copilot is one of the few tools I’d be reluctant to work without. Not because it’s perfect — but because it makes me better.And that’s what good tools are supposed to do.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Run web compatible Half-Life or Counter Strike 1.6 dedicated server using xash3d-fwgs and go pion</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1lktz9l/run_web_compatible_halflife_or_counter_strike_16/</link><author>/u/yohimik</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 07:32:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey there Recently I made a cgo wrapper for xash3d-fwgs engine which runs hl and cs Furthermore, I added a webrtc example to demonstrate how to connect to the server from the web why go? go has backend session based engines like nakama, so it's easy to run something like cs2 using just cs1.6 and gohttps://github.com/yohimik/goxash3d-fwgs]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The importance of kindness in engineering</title><link>https://ashouri.xyz/post/kindnessinengineering</link><author>/u/AlexandraLinnea</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 07:13:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[There are many traits I have seen successful engineers have over my years observing and being part of development teams but there is one trait above all others that the most successful engineers have and that is kindness.I can hear your eyes rolling from here but hear me out.Being kind does not mean being a doormat, minding your p’s and q’s or biting your lip when your team takes an action you disagree with. Sometimes it can mean being direct, arguing or even being a bit too abrupt.Remember when you just started out and a senior sat with you and explained some basic concepts behind their code without judgement and patience?Remember when you saw a colleague working on a gnarly problem and you stepped in to pair with them or vice versa?Remember when you were extremely tired and someone chased you for an update on a piece of work that was not a priority. Instead of snapping at them you took a breath and explained why you could not look into it right now but would circle back to them in a week or so?Kindness is not only about reactive patience and being helpful but also influences the way we work. For me a feature of kindness in engineering is keeping documentation like readme’s up to date because you want to help cut down on the time it would take engineers to make progress in future on the same codebase.Kindness can also be applied to writing code. For example when you write code you optimise on your team’s ability to read and comprehend the codebase because you want your colleagues to have an easier time onboarding and delivering features in the future rather than optimising on your own personal velocity.Kindness can even mean you choose not to make code more readable because your empathy leads you to believing that rearranging a pattern that the team has come to become familiar with would lead to them having to spend more time to understand changes in a codebase with low churn.Kindness also means that we write error messages with the user in mind and prioritise product features over and above technical implementation detail because we have of empathy for our users.Kindness means that you prioritise tickets that enable the team to ship quicker by reducing setup time through things like docker compose or makefiles.Kindness leads to greater cooperation, collaboration and transparency. The most productive teams I have worked on were not smartest but the kindest and the least productive team I ever worked on was ironically probably the smartest.There are lots of good engineers in the world but in my opinion the best engineers are the kindest engineers because they not only deliver world class products but they also raise the effectiveness of the entire team.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>North Korea to open beach resort as Kim Jong Un bets on tourism</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0w59r54w9o</link><author>/u/Loki-L</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 07:09:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[North Korea is opening a beach resort that its leader Kim Jong Un hopes will boost tourism in the secretive communist regime, state media reports.Wonsan Kalma on the east coast will open to domestic tourists on 1 July, six years after it was due to be completed. It is unclear when it will welcome foreigners. Kim grew up in luxury in Wonsan, where many of the country's elite have private villas, and has been trying to transform the town, which once hosted a missile testing site.State media KCNA claims the resort can accomodate up to 20,000 visitors, occupying a 4km (2.5 mile) stretch of beach, with hotels, restaurants, shopping malls and a water park - none of which can be verified.Heavily sanctioned for decades for its nuclear weapons programme, North Korea is among the poorest countries in the world. It pours most of its resources into its military, monuments and landmarks - often in Pyongyang - that embellish the image and cult of the Kim family that has run the country since 1948.Some observers say this is an easy way for Pyongyang to earn money. While foreign tourists are allowed in, tour groups largely tend to come from China and Russia,  countries with whom Pyongyang has long maintained friendly relations. "I was hoping this might signal a broader reopening to international tourism, but unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be the case for now," Rowan Beard, co-founder of Young Pioneer Tours, tells the BBC.Tourism from overseas took a hit during the Covid pandemic, though, with the country closing its borders in early 2020. It did not scale back restrictions until the middle of 2023 and welcomed Russian visitors a year later.It opened to more Western visitors in February, when tourists from the UK, France, Germany and Australia drove across the border from China. It abruptly haltedtourism weeks later without saying why.Some tour agencies are sceptical of Wonsan's appeal to foreigners. It is "unlikely to be a major draw for most Western tourists", Mr Beard says. "Key sites like Pyongyang, the DMZ, and other brutalist or communist landmarks will continue to be the main highlights for international visitors once broader tourism resumes."However, Elliott Davies, director of Uri Tours, says North Korea holds a "niche appeal" for travellers drawn to unconventional destinations."It's intriguing to experience something as familiar as a beach resort that's been shaped within the unique cultural context of North Korea."KCNA described the Wonsan development as a "great, auspicious event of the whole country" and called it a "prelude to the new era" in tourism.It was initially scheduled to open in October 2019, but ran into construction delays before the pandemic struck.Kim attended a ceremony to celebrate its completion on 24 June, accompanied by his daughter, Kim Ju Ae, and wife Ri Sol Ju. It marked Ri's first public appearance since a New Year's Day event. Russian ambassador Alexander Matsegora and embassy staff also attended.Some tour operators expect the resort to be opened to Russian tourists, who are currently the only foreign nationals allowed into some parts of the country. On Thursday, the two countries also reopened a direct passenger train route between their capitals after a five-year suspension because of the pandemic.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Optimizing Change-Driven Architectures - A New Cloud-Native Model with Drasi</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsY1OilC3A0</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/PsY1OilC3A0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 07:00:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Building change-driven solutions that respond to specific changes in distributed data is challenging.

Space.com reports: TWA 7b was discovered in the debris rings that surround the low-mass star CE Antilae, also known as TWA 7, located around 111 light-years from Earth. CE Antilae is a very young star, estimated to be around just a few million years old. If that seems ancient, consider the sun, a "middle-aged" star, is around 4.6 billion years old.
 
[...] The disk of CE Antilae is divided into three distinct rings, one of which is narrow and bounded by two empty "lanes" mostly devoid of matter. When imaging this ring, the JWST spotted an infrared-emitting source, which the team of astronomers determined is most likely a young exoplanet. They then used simulations that confirmed the formation of a thin ring and a "hole" exactly where this planet is positioned, corresponding to JWST observations.

Five flights were rerouted to Sheremetyevo Airport, Mash added.Later in the morning, Russia’s Defense Ministry said its air defense systems had intercepted and destroyed 50 Ukrainian aircraft-type drones in total:11 over the Rostov region6 over the Bryansk region3 over the Belgorod region3 over the Moscow region (including the two targeting Moscow)2 over the occupied Crimea1 each over Mordovia and the Kaluga regionAccording to the Ukrainian Air Force, from 10:00 p.m. on June 25 until the morning of June 26, Russian forces launched an attack on Ukraine using 41 Shahed strike drones and various types of simulator UAVs. The main targets were frontline areas in the Donetsk and Kharkiv regions.“As of 08:00, air defenses had neutralized 24 enemy Shahed UAVs and other drones across the east, south, and north of the country. Eight were shot down with firepower, and 16 were suppressed or lost due to electronic warfare,” the report stated.Hits of Russian attack drones were recorded in seven different locations.Andriy Kovalenko, head of the National Security and Defense Council’s Center for Countering Disinformation, said the explosion struck the Atlant-Aero plant, which he described as an important part of Russia’s military-industrial complex.According to Kovalenko, the plant manufactures key components for Orion combat drones, as well as electronic warfare systems and control technologies used in FPV strike drones and loitering munitions.The attack came during a wave of Ukrainian drone strikes overnight, with Russian officials reporting drone activity across several regions, including Rostov, which borders Ukraine.Russia’s Defense Ministry claimed its air defenses intercepted 22 drones over multiple areas, including the occupied Crimean Peninsula, and at least 7 over the Rostov region.Rostov Governor Yuri Slyusar confirmed that the strike caused damage in Taganrog. He reported that two residential buildings, a sports complex, and a school had been affected. In the nearby city of Azov, a grain storage facility and an industrial site were also reportedly hit.Drone warfare has become increasingly central in the conflict since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Ukraine has concentrated its efforts on targeting Russian military infrastructure, while Moscow continues to carry out widespread drone, missile, and rocket attacks on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure, often using Iranian-made Shahed drones in combination with ballistic and cruise missiles.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LLM code generation may lead to an erosion of trust</title><link>https://jaysthoughts.com/aithoughts1</link><author>CoffeeOnWrite</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 06:07:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Estonian national arrested near Swedish naval base for taking photographs while kayaking</title><link>https://balticsentinel.eu/8275414/estonian-national-arrested-near-swedish-naval-base-for-taking-photographs-while-kayaking</link><author>/u/Prior-Sun2352</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 05:48:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On June 21, Swedish police arrested a 56-year-old Estonian citizen kayaking near the Musko naval base in the Stockholm archipelago.

Prosecutor Julia Tibäck told Swedish newspaper Expressen that base guards spotted Zaira taking photos with her phone, prompting them to alert the police.Authorities currently have no evidence linking Zaira to any foreign intelligence service.At the hearing, Zaira admitted to entering the area and taking pictures but denied any criminal intent or gross negligence. She also challenged the necessity of her detention, calling it disproportionate.Zaira will remain in custody until trial. Prosecutor Tibäck justified the detention by citing flight risk: Zaira is not a Swedish citizen and doesn’t reside in the country. While again noting no espionage link, Tibäck acknowledged concerns were heightened due to Zaira’s foreign citizenship.Zaira’s lawyer, Sanna Älgekrans, said her client was shocked by the arrest and didn’t expect such serious consequences. Asked whether Zaira’s nationality may have influenced suspicions, Älgekrans replied, “Yes, clearly. The current climate likely played a role.”However, she stopped short of calling it discrimination. She declined to reveal what exactly appeared in Zaira’s photographs, citing confidentiality.Zaira reportedly works as an engineer near Tallinn and has long been active in endurance and adventure sports.

The micro-robots are a fraction of the width of a human hair and have been inserted successfully into animal sinuses in pre-clinical trials by researchers at universities in China and Hong Kong. Swarms are injected into the sinus cavity via a duct threaded through the nostril and guided to their target by electromagnetism, where they can be made to heat up and catalyze chemical reactions to wipe out bacterial infections. There are hopes the precisely targeted technology could eventually reduce reliance on antibiotics and other generalized medicines.
 
[...] The latest breakthrough, based on animal rather than human trials, involves magnetic particles "doped" with copper atoms which clinicians insert with a catheter before guiding to their target under a magnetic field. The swarms can be heated up by reacting to light from an optical fibre that is also inserted into the body as part of the therapy. This allows the micro-robots to loosen up and penetrate viscous pus that forms a barrier to the infection site. The light source also prompts the micro-robots to disrupt bacterial cell walls and release reactive oxygen species that kill the bacteria.
 
The study, published in Nature Robotics, showed the robots were capable of eradicating bacteria from pig sinuses and could clear infections in live rabbits with "no obvious tissue damage." The researchers have produced a model of how the technology could work on a human being, with the robot swarms being deployed in operating theatre conditions, allowing doctors to see their progress by using X-rays. Future applications could include tackling bacterial infections of the respiratory tract, stomach, intestine, bladder and urethra, they suggested. "Our proposed micro-robotic therapeutic platform offers the advantages of non-invasiveness, minimal resistance, and drug-free intervention," they said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Indian drone startup Raphe mPhibr raises $100M as military UAV demand soars</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/25/indian-drone-startup-raphe-mphibr-raises-100m-as-military-uav-demand-soars/</link><author>Jagmeet Singh</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 02:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The startup aims to boost its R&D and local production capabilities amid growing demand for drones in battlefields and for border surveillance.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Meta Beats Copyright Suit From Authors Over AI Training on Books</title><link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/06/25/2127222/meta-beats-copyright-suit-from-authors-over-ai-training-on-books?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 01:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An anonymous reader shares a report: Meta escaped a first-of-its-kind copyright lawsuit from a group of authors who alleged the tech giant hoovered up millions of copyrighted books without permission to train its generative AI model called Llama.

As a hobbyist I don't have my finger on the industrial pulse and would like to hear your thoughts and insights about the current state of Rust in general—things that are hard for me to look up on a wiki page and that requires the insights of those of you who work with it regularly or semi-regularly.What do you think about the current state of Rust as a language, ecosystem and community?I've seen some flak about async in Rust. Do you agree with it? How happy are you about the current state of the language? Is Rust your favourite language? What are your biggest gripes with the language, and do you think they will be resolved within the next 2-5 years?From what I understand, Rust jobs are rare. Is your impression that they are becoming more common? Do you think Rust will become more prevalent than C or C++ at some point?Are you happy with the Rust ecosystem, tooling, library availability and so on? Which areas shine, and which are most lacking? What are your opinions on the Rust community, in terms of demographics, friendliness, activity, open-source work and so on?My impression is that Rust is most suited to systems level programming, especially critical components where correctness is essential. Do you see Rust taking over other segments or domains?Reason I ask these questions is honestly because I would love to get psyched about Rust again, and because I would like an honest and well-informed impression of the current state of the language.Any and all insights are very welcome!Edit: I'm mostly interesting in the state of Rust as a whole, the gamedev question from the subject is secondary.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>DockedUp: A Terminal Dashboard for Docker Containers, Built in Python</title><link>https://github.com/anilrajrimal1/dockedup</link><author>/u/Fragrant_Letter8595</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 00:42:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I’ve been working on , a CLI tool that makes monitoring Docker containers easier and more intuitive. If you’re tired of juggling , , and switching terminals to check logs or restart containers, this might be for you!DockedUp is a real-time, interactive dashboard that displays your Docker containers’ status, health, CPU, and memory usage in a clean, color-coded terminal view. It automatically groups containers by docker-compose projects and uses emojis to make status (Up 🟢, Down 🔴) and health (Healthy ✅, Unhealthy ⚠️) instantly clear. Navigate containers with arrow keys and use hotkeys to: - : View live logs - : Restart a container - : Stop a container - : Open a shell inside a containerDockedUp is designed for developers and DevOps engineers who work with Docker containers and want a quick, unified view of their environment without leaving the terminal. It’s ideal for those managing docker-compose stacks in development or small-scale production setups. Whether you’re a Python enthusiast, a CLI lover, or a DevOps pro looking to streamline workflows, DockedUp is built to save you time and hassle.Unlike  and , which require multiple commands and terminal switching, DockedUp offers a single, live-updating dashboard with interactive controls. Compared to tools like Portainer (web-based) or lazydocker (another CLI), DockedUp is lightweight, focuses on docker-compose project grouping, and integrates emoji-based visual cues for quick status checks. It’s Python-based, easy to install via PyPI, and doesn’t need a web server, making it a great fit for terminal-centric workflows.It’s on PyPI and takes one command to install (I recommend  for CLI tools): bash pipx install dockedup  Or: bash pip install dockedup  Then run  to start the monitor. Check out the GitHub repo for more details and setup instructions. If you like the project, I’d really appreciate a ⭐ on GitHub to help spread the word!I’d love to hear your thoughts—any features you’d like to see or issues you run into?

From a report: Last year, the Oscar-winning writer revealed he was working on a film that would revisit the subject of Facebook, and Deadline has now reported that The Social Network Part II is in development at Sony Pictures yet isn't a "straight sequel." 

The original film, which traced the early days of Facebook and its creator Mark Zuckerberg, was directed by David Fincher. Sorkin is rumoured to be directing the follow-up. "I blame Facebook for January 6," he said in 2024 on a special edition of The Town podcast, live from Washington DC.

There, nestled in the mountains on the midwestern side of the island, a combination of experimental microgrids, solar panels, and storage kept power on for many businesses and residents. The rest of the island waited over 24 hours, and in some cases longer, for electricity to be restored.The blackout was the latest in a series of power interruptions that have come to define Puerto Rico’s aging electrical grid. Vegetation was to blame for April’s blackout, according to LUMA Energy, the private company that manages the island’s grid. A faulty old cable triggered the near total blackout on New Year’s Eve 2024, the company said. Tropical storm Ernesto’s strong winds knocked out half of the island’s power in August 2024. The problems are the result of decades of mismanagement and disinvestment in the island’s grid infrastructure. Neglecting to keep up with regular maintenance and failing to meet increasing demand for power generation have contributed to the disarray. The long-standing issues set the stage for the grid to be crushed in 2017 by Hurricane Maria, the United States’ second deadliest, which plunged Puerto Rico into months-long darkness and claimed nearly 3,000 lives. After that hurricane, the island’s state-run utility, Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), contracted with private entities for power generation, transmission, and distribution in the hopes of fixing the grid. Over $20 billion in U.S. federal disaster relief was awarded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to improve the grid and boost its resilience. Yet bureaucratic red tape and politics in Puerto Rico and on the U.S. mainland have hindered much of that money from being spent.Now, the U.S. Department of Energy plans to redirect$365 million previously earmarked for rooftop solar toward infrastructure on Puerto Rico’s majority fossil-fuel-powered grid, according to an announcement from the agency on May 21. The money will  support “practical fixes and emergency activities that offer a faster, more impactful solution to the current crisis,” the agency said. This will include “system flexibility and response, power flow and control, component strength, supply security, and safety,” according to the announcement. The move sparked an outcry from Puerto Rico’s solar industry and U.S. Representative Nydia Velazquez of New York. Velazquez, who is from Puerto Rico, called the move “shameful” in a post on X, saying the money was designed to serve vulnerable communities on the island.Solar Energy’s Role in Puerto Rico’s GridThe ongoing political turmoil and bottlenecked federal funding have prompted the widespread development of solar-plus-storage systems across the island that are privately financed via leases, loans, or Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). Each month, the island sees around 4,000 solar-plus-battery storage systems come online, Rúa-Jovet says. These installations are connected to the grid but can also operate during blackouts.At the end of March, LUMA reported over 1.14 gigawatts of grid-connected distributed solar capacity, with an additional 2.34 gigawatt-hours of distributed batteries connected to the grid. Solar power produces over 2 terawatt-hours of electricity each year, which accounts for more than 12.5 percent of Puerto Rico’s total residential electricity consumption annually. The majority of that power is generated from residential solar, and capacity continues to grow as more residents install systems with private financing. Adjuntas, which has a population of about 18,000, took a more experimental approach. The town’s local environmental nonprofit Casa Pueblo teamed up with researchers from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge, Tenn., to develop a way to connect multiple microgrids to exchange power with one another, all without having to be hooked up to Puerto Rico’s grid. The strategy, called grid orchestration, ensures that if power is knocked out on one of the installations, the others aren’t compromised. It’s what kept multiple areas in Adjuntas electrified during April’s island-wide blackout.During the blackout, Casa Pueblo and the Oak Ridge researchers were completing the testing of the orchestration strategy with three of the five microgrids connected in Adjuntas. These three microgrids are connected to the grid via net metering. The remaining two grids are isolated.“By decentralizing, it’s creating a more resilient and redundant energy setup,” says Arturo Massol-Deyá, Casa Pueblo’s executive director. “Engineers will say: If you have redundancy, that’s more resilient; that’s better.”The teams demonstrated trading energy from one microgrid to the other, and vice versa. This kind of transfer enables the system to overcome energy limitations during peak demand times and draw from additional storage at night when the sun is down. Together, the town’s five microgrids provide 228 kilowatts of photovoltaic capacity and an additional 1.2 megawatt-hours of storage, which serve residences and 15 commercial businesses. It’s a small amount of power, but an example of a way for systems to operate independently from the grid. Expanding Microgrid Connections in AdjuntasMoving forward, Massol-Deyá’s plan is to continue improving and expanding the bottom-up approach to microgrid connections. On April 20, Casa Pueblo launched a lab in Adjuntas called the Community Laboratory for the Energy Transition with the goal of bringing together academics and industry experts to test new microgrid technology as it develops. The next milestone, Massol-Deyá says, will be successfully connecting microgrids that are not in close geographic proximity. “In Adjuntas, we’re bridging the gap between simulation and theoretical work with a real application,” he says.As warmer months approach, Puerto Rico is gearing up island-wide for a season of power failures as energy demand will likely exceed Puerto Rico’s generation capacity. This will likely be compounded by a stronger-than-normal Atlantic hurricane season. Rúa-Jovet maintains that solar and batteries are an easily dispatchable resource that make a “good dent” in resiliency against island-wide power failures. Massol-Deyá agrees and says that even with the government turning toward what he calls an “obsolete” model of fossil fuel power, the Puerto Rican people are embracing solar.“It’s not top-down: It’s not by LUMA, it’s not by the government. It has been pushed by the people. You have a huge and significant investment by the people on solar,” Massol-Deyá says. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Federal judge sides with Meta in lawsuit over training AI models on copyrighted books</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/25/federal-judge-sides-with-meta-in-lawsuit-over-training-ai-models-on-copyrighted-books/</link><author>Maxwell Zeff</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 23:40:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A federal judge sided with Meta on Wednesday in a lawsuit brought against the company by 13 book authors, including Sarah Silverman, that alleged the company had illegally trained its AI models on their copyrighted works.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Brad Feld on ‘Give First’ and the art of mentorship (at any age)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/25/brad-feld-on-give-first-and-the-art-of-mentorship-at-any-age/</link><author>Connie Loizos</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 23:31:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Brad Feld has spent decades operating by a simple principle: Give without expecting anything in return. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>US Senators Push For American Version of EU&apos;s Digital Markets Act</title><link>https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/06/25/214209/us-senators-push-for-american-version-of-eus-digital-markets-act?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 23:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[U.S. lawmakers have reintroduced the bipartisan Open App Markets Act, aiming to curb Apple and Google's control over mobile app stores by promoting competition, supporting third-party marketplaces and sideloading, and safeguarding developer rights. AppleInsider reports: The Open App Markets Act seeks to do a number of things, including:
- Protect developers' rights to tell consumers about lower prices and offer competitive pricing;
- Protect sideloading of apps;
- Promote competition by opening the market to third-party app stores, startup apps, and alternative payment systems;
- Make it possible for developers to offer new experiences that take advantage of consumer device features;
- Give consumers greater control over their devices;
- Prevent app stores from disadvantaging developers; and
- Establish safeguards to preserve consumer privacy, security, and safety.
 
This isn't the first time we've seen this bill, either. In 2021, Senators Blumenthal, Klobuchar, and Blackburn had attempted to put forth the original version of the Open App Markets Act.However, the initial bill never made it to the floor for an office vote. Thanks to last-minute efforts by lobbying groups and appearances from chief executives, the bill eventually stalled out.
 
While the two bills are largely similar, the revised version introduces several key differences. Notably, the new version includes new carve-outs aimed at protecting intellectual property and addressing potential national security concerns.There's also a new clause that would prohibit punitive actions against developers for enabling remote access to other apps. The clause addition harkens back to the debacle between Apple and most game streaming services -- though in 2024, Apple loosened its App Store guidelines to allow cloud gaming and emulation.
 
There are a few new platform-protective clauses added, too. For instance, it would significantly lower the burden of proof for either Apple or Google to block platform access to a third-party app.Additionally, it reinforces the fact that companies like Apple or Google will not need to provide support or refunds for third-party apps installed outside of first-party app marketplaces. 
The full bill can be found here.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Define policy forbidding use of AI code generators</title><link>https://github.com/qemu/qemu/commit/3d40db0efc22520fa6c399cf73960dced423b048</link><author>todsacerdoti</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 23:26:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Psylo Browser Obscures Digital Fingerprints By Giving Every Tab Its Own IP Address</title><link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/06/25/2050258/psylo-browser-obscures-digital-fingerprints-by-giving-every-tab-its-own-ip-address?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 22:50:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Psylo, a new privacy-focused iOS browser by Mysk, aims to defeat digital fingerprinting by isolating each browser tab with its own IP address, unique fingerprinting defenses, and proxy-based encryption. "Psylo stands out as it is the only WebKit-based iOS browser that truly isolates tabs," Tommy Mysk told The Register. "It's not only about separate storage and cookies. Psylo goes beyond that."
 
"This is why we call tabs 'silos.' It applies unique anti-fingerprinting measures per silo, such as canvas randomization. This way two Psylo tabs opening the same website would appear as though they originated on two different devices to the opened website." From the report: The company claims Psylo therefore offers better privacy than a VPN because the virtual networks mask the user's IP address but generally don't alter the data used for fingerprinting. Psylo, for example, will adjust the browser's time zone and browser language to match the geolocation of each proxy, resulting in more entropy that means fingerprints created by gathering data from silos will appear to be different.
 
The Mysk devs' post states that some privacy-focused browsers like Brave also implement anti-fingerprinting measures like canvas randomization, but those are more effective on the desktop macOS app due to Apple's iOS restrictions. They claim that they were able to achieve better results on iOS by using a client-side JavaScript solution. Mysk designed Psylo to minimize the information available to its maker. It doesn't log personally identifiable information or browsing data that the curious could use to identify the user, the company claims, noting that it also doesn't have customer payment information, which is handled by Apple. There are no user accounts, only randomized identifiers to indicate active subscriptions. According to Tommy Mysk, the only subscriber data kept is bandwidth usage, which is necessary to prevent abuse.
 
"We aggregate bandwidth usage based on a randomly generated ID that is created when a subscription is made," Mysk said. "The randomly generated ID is associated with the Apple subscription transaction. Apple doesn't share the identity of users making App Store purchases with developers." Asked whether Apple could identify users, Mysk said, "Theoretically and given a court order, Apple can figure out the randomly generated ID of the user in question. If we were to hand out the data associated with the randomly generated ID, it would only be the bandwidth usage of that user in the current month, and two months in the past. Older data is automatically deleted. "We don't associate any identifiable information with the randomly generated ID. We don't store IP addresses at all in every component of our system. We don't store websites visited by our users at all." The browser is only available on iOS and iPadOS, but Mysk says an Android version could be developed if there's enough interest. It costs $9.99 per month or $99 per year in the U.S.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Wails goroutine question</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1lkjzr3/wails_goroutine_question/</link><author>/u/New_Okra5546</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 22:46:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Wails is a lightweight and fast Electron/Tauri alternative for Go, and uses WebKit2What makes Wails special is the following:Bind your Go code to the frontend so it can be called from JavaScriptNow if you created lets say a new Wails + React project.

If emissions remain at their current rate – around 40 billion per year – that gives roughly three years before the “carbon budget” is spent.The Paris Agreement, signed in 2015 by nearly 200 countries, set a target of limiting warming to 1.5C above temperatures set in the late 1800s before global industrialisation.The current rate of global warming is 0.27C per decade, which is much faster than at any point in the Earth’s history.If this keeps up, the planet will breach the 1.5C target by 2030.Professor Piers Forster, lead author of the report and director of the Priestley Centre for Climate Futures at the University of Leeds, told the BBC: “Things are all moving in the wrong direction.“We're seeing some unprecedented changes and we're also seeing the heating of the Earth and sea-level rise accelerating as well.”There are hopes that CO2 can be sucked out of the atmosphere in a bid to reverse global warming, however scientists caution against seeing this as a solution.Joeri Rogelj, professor of climate science and policy at Imperial College London, said: “For larger exceedance [of 1.5C], it becomes less likely that removals [of CO2] will perfectly reverse the warming caused by today's emissions."The report found that the Earth’s “energy imbalance” – the rate at which extra heat accumulates in the climate system – is increasing.Over the last decade or so, this rate of heating is more than doubled since the 1970s and 1980s and is 25% than in the 2000s and 2010s.Dr Matthew Palmer of the UK Met Office said this was a “very worrying number” over a  short period of time.Much of this extra heat – around 90% – is absorbed by the oceans, wrecking havoc on marine life and raising sea levels because ice melts.While the warnings from the report are stark, its authors said that the rate of emissions increases appears to be slowing as new clean tech is being used.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Stop talking about Fedora change proposals like they have already decided on it.</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1lkjj8l/stop_talking_about_fedora_change_proposals_like/</link><author>/u/wowieniceusername</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 22:27:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Seriously.

The poor showing comes after Tesla's billionaire CEO had promised a “major rebound” was coming last month, adding to a recent buying frenzy among investors.They were selling on Wednesday, pushing the prices down more than 4% in early afternoon trading.Musk had said Tesla was sure to get a boost once the company was done retooling its factories to produce a new version of its biggest seller, the Model Y. But that was finished months ago, and the new models are widely available. Investors are now hoping that a cheaper Tesla expected to be out later year will help reverse the sales decline. Overall, battery electric vehicle sales rose 25% in Europe compared to a year earlier. The market for EVs was particularly strong in Germany, where Musk has angered potential buyers by publicly supporting the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party in elections. Overall EV sales there leapt 45%.China’s SAIC Motor was the big winner for the month with its European sales of EVs and other kinds of cars jumping 38%. That has allowed the company to leapfrog Tesla, which a year ago was selling more cars in the region.SAIC sold 18,716 vehicles last month versus Tesla’s 8,729.The sales drop for Tesla comes at a crucial time for the company as it launches a test run of its driverless ‘robotaxis’ service in Austin, Texas. Musk says that if goes well, he expects to introduce the service in several other cities in quick succession and have as many as a million of the automated cabs on roads by the end of the year.Reviews so far have been mostly good, but the service is limited to a dozen or so cars and some passengers have circulated videos of problems during their rides, including one showing a robotaxi heading down a lane for opposing traffic. Federal traffic safety regulators said Tuesday they were looking into the videos.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Bazzite Would Shut Down If Fedora Goes Ahead With Removing 32-Bit</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/06/25/2042242/bazzite-would-shut-down-if-fedora-goes-ahead-with-removing-32-bit?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 22:10:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If Fedora drops 32-bit support, the gaming-focused Bazzite project would be forced to shut down, according to its founder Kyle Gospodnetich. "As much as I'd like this change to happen, it's too soon," said Gospodneitch in a post. "This change would kill off projects like Bazzite entirely right as Fedora is starting to make major headway in the gaming space. Neal Gompa already pointed out basic use cases that would be broken even if someone built the packages Steam itself needs to function."
 
He continued: "It's also causing irreparable damage to Fedora from a PR standpoint. I have been inundated all day with people sharing news articles and being genuinely concerned Steam is gong to stop working on their Fedora/Bazzite machines. I would argue not only should this change be rejected, the proposal should be rescinded to limit further damage to Fedora as a project. Perhaps open a separate one to talk about changing build architecture to build fewer 32-bit packages?"
 
When pushed further, Gospodnetich said: "I'm speaking as it's founder, if this change is actually made as it is written the best option for us is to just go ahead and disband the project."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Rona is with Us</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ybBLBiopZwQ</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ybBLBiopZwQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 22:07:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Edmontosaurus Abandoned Their Young To Survive</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvm2VvV7bhA</link><author>PBS</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/mvm2VvV7bhA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 22:00:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgyeJxD05YnoDquRMNBfBqw">PBS</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Follow us over to the PBS App or PBS.org to watch more Walking with Dinosaurs! https://to.pbs.org/WalkingWithDinosaurs

You might, for instance, let parts of the shape weigh nothing at all, while concentrating a large amount of mass in other parts.But that wasn’t entirely satisfying to the mathematicians. Almádi, Dawson and Domokos wanted to hold the shape in their hands. Was it possible to make a monostable tetrahedron in the real world, with real materials?The team returned to their computer search. They considered the various ways in which monostable tetrahedra might tip onto their stable face. For instance, one kind of tetrahedron might follow a very simple path: Face A tips to Face B, which tips to Face C, which tips to Face D. But in a different tetrahedron, Face A might tip to Face B, and both Face B and Face D will tip to Face C.The loading zones for these different tetrahedra look very different. The team calculated that to get one of these “falling patterns” to work, they would need to construct part of the shape out of a material about 1.5 times as dense as the sun’s core.They focused on a more feasible falling pattern. Even so, part of their tetrahedron would have to be about 5,000 times as dense as the rest of it. And the materials had to be stiff — light, flimsy materials that could bend would ruin the project, since it’s easy to make a round or smooth shape (like the roly-poly) monostable.In the end, they designed a tetrahedron that was mostly hollow. It consisted of a lightweight carbon fiber frame and one small portion constructed out of tungsten carbide, which is denser than lead. For the lighter portions to have as little weight as possible, even the carbon fiber frames had to be hollow.With this blueprint in hand, Domokos got in touch with a precision engineering company in Hungary to help build the tetrahedron. They had to be incredibly accurate in their measurements, even when it came to the weight of the tiny amounts of glue used to connect each of the shape’s faces. Several frustrating months and several thousand euros later, the team had a lovely model that didn’t work at all. Then Domokos and the chief engineer of the model spotted a glob of stray glue clinging to one of its vertices. They asked a technician to remove it. About 20 minutes later, the glue was gone and Almádi received a text from Domokos.“It works,” the message read. Almádi, who was on a walk, started jumping up and down in the street. “Seeing the lines on the computer is very far from reality,” he said. “That we designed it, and it works, it’s kind of fantastic.”“I wanted to be an architect,” he added. “So this is still very strange for me — how did I end up here?”In the end, the work on monostable tetrahedra didn’t involve any particularly sophisticated math, according to Richard Schwartz of Brown University. But, he said, it’s important to ask this kind of question in the first place. It’s the kind of problem that’s often easiest to overlook. “It’s a surprising thing, a leap, to conjecture that these things would exist,” Schwartz said.At the moment, it’s not clear what new theoretical insights the model of the monostable tetrahedron will provide — but experimenting with it might help mathematicians uncover other intriguing questions to ask about polyhedra. In the meantime, Domokos and Almádi are working to apply what they learned from their construction to help engineers design lunar landers that can turn themselves right side up after falling over.In any case, sometimes you just need to see something to believe it, Schwartz said. “Even for theoretical math, geometry especially, people are kind of right to be skeptical because it’s quite hard to reason spatially. And you can make mistakes, people do.”“Conway didn’t say anything about it, he just suggested it — never proved it, never proved it wrong, nothing. And now here we are, I don’t know, 60 years later,” Almádi said. “If he were still alive, we could put this on his desk and show him: You were right.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>This Is Marc Benioff&apos;s Eras Tour</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/gy54SMwAbuk</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/gy54SMwAbuk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 20:00:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA["I'm like the Taylor Swift of tech."

In the process, the company cut millions of print books from their bindings, scanned them into digital files, and threw away the originals solely for the purpose of training AI—details buried in a copyright ruling on fair use whose broader fair use implications we reported yesterday.The 32-page legal decision tells the story of how, in February 2024, the company hired Tom Turvey, the former head of partnerships for the Google Books book-scanning project, and tasked him with obtaining "all the books in the world." The strategic hire appears to have been designed to replicate Google's legally successful book digitization approach—the same scanning operation that survived copyright challenges and established key fair use precedents.While destructive scanning is a common practice among some book digitizing operations, Anthropic's approach was somewhat unusual due to its documented massive scale. By contrast, the Google Books project largely used a patentednon-destructive camera process to scan millions of books borrowed from libraries and later returned. For Anthropic, the faster speed and lower cost of the destructive process appears to have trumped any need for preserving the physical books themselves, hinting at the need for a cheap and easy solution in a highly competitive industry.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>-2000 Lines of code</title><link>https://www.folklore.org/Negative_2000_Lines_Of_Code.html</link><author>xeonmc</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 19:53:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In early 1982, the Lisa software team was trying to buckle down for the big push to ship the software within the next six months.  Some of the managers decided that it would be a good idea to track the progress of each individual engineer in terms of the amount of code that they wrote from week to week.  They devised a form that each engineer was required to submit every Friday, which included a field for the number of lines of code that were written that week.
Bill Atkinson, the author of Quickdraw and the main user interface designer, who was by far the most important Lisa implementer, thought that lines of code was a silly measure of software productivity.  He thought his goal was to write as small and fast a program as possible, and that the lines of code metric only encouraged writing sloppy, bloated, broken code.
He recently was working on optimizing Quickdraw's region calculation machinery, and had completely rewritten the region engine using a simpler, more general algorithm which, after some tweaking, made region operations almost six times faster.  As a by-product, the rewrite also saved around 2,000 lines of code.
He was just putting the finishing touches on the optimization when it was time to fill out the management form for the first time.  When he got to the lines of code part, he thought about it for a second, and then wrote in the number: -2000.
I'm not sure how the managers reacted to that, but I do know that after a couple more weeks, they stopped asking Bill to fill out the form, and he gladly complied.

definition of ‘create’). It is to this principle that I believe I owe everything I’m truly good at. Some will tell you
to avoid reinventing the wheel, but they’re wrong: you  build your own wheel, because it’ll teach you more about
how they work than reading a thousand books on them ever will.In 2025, the beauty and craft of writing software is being eroded. AI is threatening to replace us (or, at least, the
most joyful aspects of our craft) and software development is being increasingly commodified, measured, packaged, and
industrialised. Software development needs more simple joy, and I’ve found that creating toy programs is a great way to
remember why I started working with computers again.Toy programs follow the 80:20 rule: 20% of the work, 80% of the functionality. The point is  to build
production-worthy software (although it is true that some of the best production software began life as a toy).
Aggressively avoid over-engineering, restrict yourself to only whatever code is necessary to achieve your goal. Have
every code path panic/crash until you’re forced to implement it to make progress. You might be surprised by just how
easy it is to build toy versions of software you might previously have considered to be insummountably difficult to
create.I’ve been consistently surprised by just how often some arcane nugget of knowledge I’ve acquired when working on a toy
project has turned out to be immensely valuable in my day job, either by giving me a head-start on tracking down a
problem in a tool or library, or by recognising mistakes before they’re made.Understanding the constraints that define the shape of software is vital for working with it, and there’s no better way
to gain insight into those constraints than by running into them head-first. You might even come up with some novel
solutions!Here is a list of toy programs I’ve attempted over the past 15 years, rated by difficulty and time required. These
ratings are estimates and assume that you’re already comfortable with at least one general-purpose programming language
and that, like me, you tend to only have an hour or two per day free to write code. Also included are some suggested
resources that I found useful.Regex engine (difficulty = 4/10, time = 5 days)A regex engine that can read a POSIX-style regex program and recognise strings that match it. Regex is simple yet
shockingly expressive, and writing a competent regex engine will teach you everything you need to know about using the
language too.x86 OS kernel (difficulty = 7/10, time = 2 months)A multiboot-compatible OS kernel with a simple CLI, keyboard/mouse driver, ANSI escape sequence support, memory manager,
scheduler, etc. Additional challenges include writing an in-memory filesystem, user mode and process isolation, loading
ELF executables, and supporting enough video hardware to render a GUI.GameBoy/NES emulator (difficulty = 6/10, time = 3 weeks)A crude emulator for the simplest GameBoy or NES games. The GB and the NES are classics, and both have relatively simple
instruction sets and peripheral hardware. Additional challenges include writing competent PPU (video) and PSG (audio)
implementations, along with dealing with some of the more exotic cartridge formats.GameBoy Advance game (difficulty = 3/10, time = 2 weeks)A sprite-based game (top-down or side-on platform). The GBA is a beautiful little console to write code for and there’s
an active and dedicated development community for the console. I truly believe that the GBA is one of the last game
consoles that can be fully and completely understood by a single developer, right down to instruction timings.Physics engine (difficulty = 5/10, time = 1 week)A 2D rigid body physics engine that implements Newtonian physics with support for rectangles, circles, etc. On the
simplest end, just spheres that push away from one-another is quite simple to implement. Things start to get complex
when you introduce more complex shapes, angular momentum, and the like. Additional challenges include making collision
resolution fast and scaleable, having complex interactions move toward a steady state over time, soft-body interactions,
etc.Dynamic interpreter (difficulty = 4/10, time = 1-2 weeks)A tree-walking interpreter for a JavaScript-like language with basic flow control. There’s an unbounded list of extra
things to add to this one, but being able to write programs in my own language still gives me child-like elation. It
feels like a sort of techno-genesis: once you’ve got your own language, you can start building the universe within it.Compiler for a C-like (difficulty = 8/10, time = 3 months)A compiler for a simply-typed C-like programming language with support for at least one target archtecture. Extra
challenges include implementing some of the most common optimisations (inlining, const folding, loop-invariant code
motion, etc.) and designing an intermediate representation (IR) that’s general enough to support multiple backends.Text editor (difficulty = 5/10, time = 2-4 weeks)This one has a lot of variability. At the blunt end, simply reading and writing a file can be done in a few lines of
Python. But building something that’s closer to a daily driver gets more complex. You could choose to implement the UI
using a toolkit like QT or GTK, but I personally favour an editor that works in the console. Properly handling unicode,
syntax highlighting, cursor movement, multi-buffer support, panes/windows, tabs, search/find functionality, LSP support,
etc. can all add between a week or a month to the project. But if you persist, you might join the elite company of those
developers who use an editor of their own creation.Async runtime (difficulty = 6/10, time = 1 week)There’s a lot of language-specific variability as to what ‘async’ actually means. In Rust, at least, this means a
library that can ingest  tasks and poll them concurrently until completion. Adding support for I/O waking
makes for a fun challenge.Hash map (difficulty = 4/10, time = 3-5 days)Hash maps (or sets/dictionaries, as a higher-level language might call them) are a programmer’s bread & butter. And yet,
surprisingly few of us understand how they really work under the bonnet. There are a plethora of techniques to throw
into the mix too: closed or open addressing, tombstones, the robin hood rule, etc. You’ll gain an appreciation for when
and why they’re fast, and also when you should just use a vector + linear search.Rasteriser / texture-mapper (difficulty = 6/10, time = 2 weeks)Most of us have played with simple 3D graphics at some point, but how many of us truly understand how the graphics
pipeline works and, more to the point, how to fix it when it doesn’t work? Writing your own software rasteriser will
give you that knowledge, along with a new-found appreciation for the beauty of vector maths and half-spaces that have
applications across many other fields. Additional complexity involves properly implementing clipping, a Z-buffer, N-gon
rasterisation, perspective-correct texture-mapping, Phong or Gouraud shading, shadow-mapping, etc.SDF Rendering (difficulty = 5/10, time = 3 days)Signed Distance Fields are a beautifully simple way to render 3D spaces defined through mathematics, and are perfectly
suited to demoscene shaders. With relatively little work you can build yourself a cute little visualisation or some
moving shapes like the graphics demos of the 80s. You’ll also gain an appreciation for shader languages and vector
maths.Voxel engine (difficulty = 5/10, time = 2 weeks)I doubt there are many reading this that haven’t played Minecraft. It’s surprisingly easy to build your own toy voxel
engine cut from a similar cloth, especially if you’ve got some knowledge of 3D graphics or game development already. The
simplicity of a voxel engine, combined with the near-limitless creativity that can be expressed with them, never ceases
to fill me with joy. Additional complexity can be added by tackling textures, more complex procedural generation,
floodfill lighting, collisions, dynamic fluids, sending voxel data over the network, etc.Threaded Virtual Machine (difficulty = 6/10, time = 1 week)Writing interpreters is great fun. What’s more fun? . If you keep pushing interpreters as far as
they can go without doing architecture-specific codegen (like AOT or JIT), you’ll eventually wind up (re)discovering
 (not to be confused with multi-threading, which is a very different beast). It’s a beautiful way of
weaving programs together out highly-optimised miniature programs, and a decent implementation can even give an AOT
compiler a run for its money in the performance department.GUI Toolkit (difficulty = 6/10, time = 2-3 weeks)Most of us have probably cobbled together a GUI program using tkinter, GTK, QT, or WinForms. But why not try writing
your GUI toolkit? Additional complexity involves implementing a competent layout engine, good text shaping (inc.
unicode support), accessibility support, and more. Fair warning: do not encourage people to use your tool unless it’s
 - the world has enough GUIs with little-to-no accessibility or localisation support.Orbital Mechanics Sim (difficulty = 6/10, time = 1 week)A simple simulation of Newtonian gravity can be cobbled together in a fairly short time. Infamously, gravitational
systems with more than two bodies cannot be solved analytically, so you’ll have to get familiar with iterative
 methods. Additional complexity comes with implementing more precise and faster integration methods,
accounting for relativistic effects, and writing a visualiser. If you’ve got the maths right, you can even try plugging
in real numbers from NASA to predict the next high tide or full moon.Bitwise Challenge (difficulty = 3/10, time = 2-3 days)Here’s one I came up with for myself, but I think it would make for a great game jam: write a game that only persists 64
bits of state between subsequent frames. That’s 64 bits for everything: the entire frame-for-frame game state should be
reproducible using only 64 bits of data. It sounds simple, but it forces you to get incredibly creative with your game
state management. Details about the rules can be found on the GitHub page below.An ECS Framework (difficulty = 4/10, time = 1-2 weeks)For all those game devs out there: try building your own ECS
framework. It’s not as hard as you might think (you might have accidentally done it already!). Extra points if you can
build in safety and correctness features, as well as good integration with your programming language of choice’s type
system features.I built a custom ECS for my Super Mario 64 on the GBA project due to the
unique performance and memory constraints of the platform, and enjoyed it a lot.CHIP-8 Emulator (difficulty = 3/10, time = 3-6 days)The CHIP-8 is a beautifully simple virtual machine from the 70s. You can write
a fully compliant emulator in a day or two, and there are an enormous plethora of fan-made games that run on it.
Here’s a game I made for it.Chess engine (difficulty = 5/10, time = 2-5 days)Writing a chess engine is great fun. You’ll start off with every move it makes being illegal, but over time it’ll get
smart and smarter. Experiencing a loss to your own chess engine really is a rite of passage, and it feels magical.POSIX shell (difficulty = 4/10, time = 3-5 days)We interact with shells every day, and building one will teach you can incredible amount about POSIX - how it works, and
how it doesn’t. A simple one can be built in a day, but compliance with an existing shell language will take time and
teach you more than you ever wanted to know about its quirks.A note on learning and LLMsPerhaps you’re a user of LLMs. I get it, they’re neat tools. They’re useful for certain kinds of learning. But I might
suggest resisting the temptation to use them for projects like this. Knowledge is not supposed to be fed to you on a
plate. If you want that sort of learning, read a book - the joy in building toy projects like this comes from an
exploration of the unknown, without polluting one’s mind with an existing solution. If you’ve been using LLMs for a
while, this cold-turkey approach might even be painful at first, but persist. There is no joy without pain.The runner’s high doesn’t come to those that take the bus.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ubuntu disables Intel GPU security mitigations, promises 20% performance boost</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/ubuntu-disables-intel-gpu-security-mitigations-promises-20-performance-boost/</link><author>Dan Goodin</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/graphics-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 19:39:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ubuntu users could see up to a 20 percent boost in graphics performance on Intel-based systems under a change that will turn off security mitigations for blunting a class of attacks known as Spectre.Spectre, you may recall, came to public notice in 2018. Spectre attacks are based on the observation that performance enhancements built into modern CPUs open a side channel that can leak secrets a CPU is processing. The performance enhancement, known as speculative execution, predicts future instructions a CPU might receive and then performs the corresponding tasks before they are even called. If the instructions never come, the CPU discards the work it performed. When the prediction is correct, the CPU has already completed the task.By using code that forces a CPU to execute carefully selected instructions, Spectre attacks can extract confidential data that the CPU would have accessed had it carried out the ghost instructions. Over the past seven years, researchers have uncovered multiple attack variants based on the architectural flaws, which are unfixable. CPU manufacturers have responded by creating patches in both micro code and binary code that restrict speculative execution operations in certain scenarios. These restrictions, of course, usually degrade CPU performance.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Coccinelle for Rust progress report</title><link>https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/blog/2025/06/25/coccinelle-for-rust-progress-report/</link><author>/u/mfilion</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 19:24:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In collaboration with Inria (the French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation), Tathagata Roy shares the progress made over the past year on the CoccinelleForRust project, co-sponsored by Collabora.Coccinelle is a tool for automatic program matching and transformation that was originally developed for making large-scale changes to the Linux kernel source code (i.e., C code). Matches and transformations are driven by user-specific transformation rules in the form of abstracted patches, referred to as . As the Linux kernel—and systems software more generally—is starting to adopt Rust, we are developing Coccinelle for Rust to make the power of Coccinelle available to Rust codebases.This diff illustrates a patch in which the  function was being called  confirming that the target item’s trait was implemented. A straightforward CfR-based fix is to find every expression of the form
expression.type_of(impl_id)

expression.type_of(impl_id).subst_identity()
There are roughly fifty occurrences of this pattern in the diff, so updating them all by hand would be quite tedious. The accompanying Semantic Patch to perform this transformation automatically is:@change_ty_of@
expression exp1, impl_id;
@@

-exp1.type_of(impl_id)
+exp1.type_of(impl_id).subst_identity()
While the above example could be achieved with a complicated and unreadable regex pattern, things can quickly become more complex.The following patch changes a function signature and all the related calls.@change_sig@
expression x;
identifier fname, sname;
@@

impl sname {
    ...
    pub(crate) fn fname(&self,
-       guard: &RevocableGuard<'_>
    ) -> Result { ... }
    ...
}

@modify_calls@
expression x, guard;
identifier change_sig.fname;
@@

x.fname(
    ...
-   guard
)
Rule  finds all the occurrences of functions which take a  of type  and removes that parameter. The rule  updates the calls to that method.This semantic patch can be used on a whole code-base where once a  variable is no longer needed, it can be removed. It can also serve as an integration test to check that no such code is present in new pull requests.Developments (2024–Present)Core pattern-matching engine using CTL.Shared with C version, adapted for Rust’s expression-heavy syntax.Performance optimized with s and hash tables.SmPL includes Rust + custom syntax (, , , disjunctions).Custom parser for SmPL constructs; uses Rust Analyzer for Rust code.Define code transformations scoped to an environment.Support for rule inheritance.Rule dependencies not yet implemented.Connects code segments within the same control flow.Higher complexity due to Rust’s flexible syntax. not yet supported.Alternative code match options.Can combine with ellipses for complex patterns.Developments in detail: 2024–PresentComputational Tree Logic (CTL) is the heart of Coccinelle, which takes semantic patches and generalizes them over Rust files. Prior to using this engine, CfR used an ad-hoc method for matching patterns of code. This engine is the same as the one used for Coccinelle for C, with a few minor changes. Most of the changes were idiomatic but to the same effect. More information on the engine and its language (CTL-VW) can be found in the POPL Paper. With a standard engine, each step of the matching process can be logged, allowing us to learn and reuse the same design patterns from Coccinelle for C, including critical test cases.The expression-dominated nature of Rust makes the matching and transformation process a bit different from that of C. For example, in the following semantic patch:@@
expression e
@@

-foo(e);
for C,  would be guaranteed to be present as an immediate child of a block, i.e.:{           // <- start of a block
    foo(e); // <- this statement
}
Blocks in C are present only in specific parts of the Abstract Syntax Tree, like in function definitions, loops, or conditional blocks. However, in Rust, blocks are expressions, which can appear anywhere an expression is allowed. For example:while { f(&mut a); a > 1 } {
    //
}
This makes searching much more computationally intensive. Thus, several optimizations were implemented in CfR to address this problem, including replacing lists in the CTL engine with s and hash tables.Semantic Patch Language (SmPL)While developing the parser for SmPL, we decided not to reinvent the wheel by writing a parser for the Rust language from scratch. SmPL contains custom syntax such as dots (), disjunctions, and modifiers ( and ). In the latest version, we parse only these constructs ourselves and hand off the rest to Rust Analyzer.A  refers to a set of changes given an environment. Multiple rules can inherit values from one another to transform code in different parts of a file.Used in SmPL as , ellipses connect two blocks of code:@@
expression q;
@@

drop_queue(q);
...
pop(q);
This is implemented in CTL using the  term.Disjunctions allow for conditional matching:f1(10);
(   // <--- disjunction start
foo(1);
|
bar(10);
)   // <--- disjunction end
f2();
Transforming macros posed a problem because of their non-standard nature. For example, should the following semantic patch match@@
expression e;
@@

foo!(
- e
+ 2
);
To avoid discrepancies, we support only macros which look like function calls. For example,  or .Pretty Printing has been improved. The transformed code is formatted using  and it is then compared with the formatting from the original code. This way only the transformed code is formatted without messing up the original file formatting.  Pretty printing is still a work-in-progress for rust macros as they are notoriously hard to deal with and  thus leaves them alone.Better tests have been added.A more robust UI has been implemented, with various debugging flags.Our current aim is to bring Coccinelle For Rust at par with Coccinelle For C in terms of basic functionalities. In the following months we are going on to work on:Rule Dependance - It lets a rule run only if a condition is satisfied by the rules before it.Scripting - Lets the user run arbitrary code for each match, allowing them to perform more things that are out of scope for now. This includes counting instances, matching with regex and performing other arbitrary operations.If you want to try out CoccinelleForRust it is available on Gitlab.

Matin mentioned that the TypeScript version will continue to receive bugfixes for now and that the focus is on bringing the native Rust build to feature parity and eventually making it the default.4 Benefits of Rust at Its CoreWhile Rust has its own set of problems and benefits, the switch isn’t about language ideology. As Matin put it, “We want to use the best tool for the job.” Codex CLI may have launched with “a neat terminal UI” built on React. However, he said that, at its core, the CLI functions as a tool working in a loop that keeps talking to the AI model and working with the system, instead of simply displaying a nice terminal interface. For that kind of repeated interaction with local system resources and APIs, TypeScript began to fall short.“We wanted to improve a few areas,” Matin explained. First, the installation experience required improvement, as the current version “requires Node v22+, which can be frustrating or a blocker for some users”. Second, improvements were to be made in native security bindings. “We already ship a Rust for Linux sandboxing since the bindings were available.” And third, the focus was on runtime performance. “No runtime garbage collection, resulting in lower memory consumption.”Beyond performance, Rust offered architectural breathing room. Matin said OpenAI is developing a “wire protocol” for Codex CLI, which will enable developers to extend the agent using various languages, such as TypeScript/JavaScript and Python. Rust is already supported for MCPs.In other words, Codex CLI isn’t just a tool; it aims to evolve into a cross-language, plug-in-friendly runtime for model-based automation.Work in Progress, but ‘Butter Smooth’While the new Rust version is still under development, the response so far has been optimistic. One developer reported that “codex native is butter smooth so far”, even though there are still some discrepancies between the TypeScript and native versions. This includes configuration file support and the ability to use the free tier mode or log in with an OpenAI account.OpenAI is systematically addressing those gaps. In a separate GitHub thread, Michael Bolin, a member of technical staff at OpenAI, categorised the remaining work as P0 (must-fix), P1 (feature parity), and P2 (quality-of-life). High-priority features for the native Rust version include ‘Sign in with ChatGPT’ and improved interruption handling. Other features, like session management and prompt suggestions, are set to follow after the feature parity is handled.“We will ultimately be retiring the TypeScript version of the CLI in favour of the Rust one,” Bolin wrote in the GitHub thread. The roadmap reflects a methodical upgrade path rather than a rushed rewrite.Native is the New Normal?The move fits a larger industry narrative. On Hacker News, a user called it part of a “recent resurgence of tools going native”. The user explained that the notion of JIT (just-in-time) interpreters becoming better and eliminating the need for native languages is increasingly being challenged.Meanwhile, another user noted that Rust and Go have made native development far more accessible. “The package management is better, and statically linked native binaries eliminate so many deployment headaches,” the user wrote.With Rust, OpenAI isn’t just changing the codebase; it’s changing what kind of software Codex CLI can be. From terminal utility to programmable agent harness, the CLI is being rebuilt not just for speed, but also for flexibility, portability, and long-term maintainability. If the TypeScript version was deployed for a playground, the Rust rewrite is planned to be ready for the real world.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Should small towns still have volunteer EMS?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eds_MxfNw5Q</link><author>Vox</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/eds_MxfNw5Q?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 18:36:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA">Vox</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The US volunteer fire and ambulance shortage, explained.

Thanks to our sponsor, T-Mobile: http://t-mobile.com/FirstResponders

In US small towns, emergency fire and ambulance first responder agencies are still mostly staffed by volunteers – a practice put in place in the 1970s and 1980s. But these volunteers are increasingly older, with fewer young people signing up than previous decades. Higher cost of living and a diminishing rural population has made volunteering less appealing than it used to be. We interviewed experts in the field of emergency response to figure out how to get those volunteers back, and the answer may be a simple one: pay them for their time.

According to  on June 25, the system—nicknamed the Ukrainian KAB—is already undergoing test flights and achieving ranges up to 60 kilometers, with plans to extend it to 80 kilometers.The project is being led by the Ukrainian design bureau “Medoid,” which confirmed the system has been successfully dropped from a Su-24 frontline bomber in level flight. Developers intentionally replicated the exterior design of the Russian UMPK to reduce development time but note that the internal components differ, particularly in aiming for greater precision.The glide kit, designed for use with 500 kg bombs, includes domestically manufactured guidance and wing modules. According to Medoid’s representative, Oleg Vostrykh, the navigation system is Ukrainian-built, although tests are also being conducted with a navigation unit from a leading French manufacturer to improve resistance to electronic warfare. Some components, however, still need to be sourced from abroad.At this stage, the system is capable of striking targets at 60 kilometers, matching operational requirements set jointly by the Ministry of Defense and the design bureau. The team is now working to increase the effective range to 80 kilometers. Under optimal conditions, such as a release altitude of 10 kilometers, the theoretical maximum range could reach 100 kilometers, depending on tactical use.The current test phase involves a series of trial drops, with initial results confirming the effectiveness of the release and glide systems. Further tests are required to complete the certification process through the Ministry of Defense. However, Vostrykh emphasized that funding remains the primary obstacle to accelerating development and entering mass production.The design bureau has launched a fundraising campaign through its own Foundation for Advanced Technologies, estimating the cost of one unit at approximately 1.2 million hryvnias, or about $25,000. According to Medoid, Ukrainian forces require at least 100 guided bombs of this type per day, a demand that is not fully met by Western-supplied systems such as JDAM-ER, AASM Hammer, or GBU-39/B SDB. In comparison, even the current prototype is already more cost-effective than foreign alternatives.Earlier, reported that Ukraine’s new Lima electronic warfare system has outperformed both Russian and Western counterparts in jamming guided aerial bombs used in Russian attacks.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mozilla Formally Discontinues Its DeepSpeech Project</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Mozilla-DeepSpeech-Discontinued</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 18:15:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the interesting projects engaged in by Mozilla that directly wasn't related to their web browser efforts was DeepSpeech, an embedded/offline speech-to-text engine.

Even more so if the founder happens to be from Africa. Bereket Engida, a self-taught programmer from Ethiopia, is quietly building what some developers say is the best authentication tool they’ve ever used.Engida’s startup, Better Auth, offers an open source framework that promises to simplify how developers manage user authentication, and it’s caught the attention of some big name investors. It recently raised about $5 million in seed funding from Peak XV (formerly Sequoia India and Southeast Asia), Y Combinator, P1 Ventures, and Chapter One. But the most interesting part here isn’t who’s on the startup’s cap table: Engida says he built the entire product back home in Ethiopia before he set foot in the U.S.Engida told TechCrunch that he started programming at 18 after a friend declined to help him build an e-commerce search app, and he started working on the project himself. He went on to land some remote software jobs and eventually built a web analytics platform that lets developers monitor user behavior on their websites. But throughout his various jobs, Engida says he kept seeing an issue popping up everywhere: authentication. Every app needs to manage how users sign in and out and reset passwords, and sometimes administrators need to handle permissions and user roles. But he found existing tools were either too limited or too rigid — companies like Auth0, Firebase, and NextAuth offer managed services, but they store user data externally, limit customization, and are expensive at scale.“I remember needing an organization feature. It’s a very common use case for most SaaS applications, but it wasn’t available from these providers,” Engida told TechCrunch. “So I had to build it from scratch. It took me about two weeks, and I remember thinking, ‘This is crazy; there has to be a better way to solve this.’”He then scrapped that project and began working on a TypeScript-based authentication framework that would let developers access user data via open source libraries, support common permissions use cases — like teams and roles — out of the box, and scale with plug-ins.“The idea was that you could add advanced features in just two or three lines of code,” Engida said.Over six months working mostly from his bedroom in Ethiopia, Engida built the first version of the library that would go on to become Better Auth. When he posted it to GitHub in September 2024, developers quickly saw the potential. Since then, Better Auth has clocked 150,000+ weekly downloads, 15,000+ GitHub stars, and a community of over 6,000 Discord members, the startup claims. Better Auth’s pitch is simple: Let developers implement everything from simple authentication flows to enterprise-grade systems directly on their databases and embed it all on the back end. Unlike hosted services, Better Auth is an open source library that developers can integrate directly into their codebase, keeping all user data on premise, in their database. For companies wary of handing over critical user information to third parties, this feature alone is a major point.The library has also found unexpected traction among early-stage AI startups, which need to build custom authentication flows that integrate with proprietary APIs, manage tokens securely, and be able to scale without racking up high costs.“We first heard about the product from numerous startups we’ve worked with,” said Arnav Sahu, partner at Peak XV and former principal at Y Combinator. “Their auth product has seen phenomenal adoption among the next generation of AI startups.” Better Auth marks Peak XV’s first direct investment in an African founder.Engida says Better Auth, currently free to use, will focus on improving its core features and launch a paid enterprise infrastructure that plugs into its open source base. This will give developers the flexibility to self-host or opt for Better Auth’s cloud add-ons as needed.He’s also thinking about how to scale without trading away the product’s community-built feel. On the roadmap, therefore, is hiring a small team to help maintain the codebase, expand documentation, and support enterprise users. For now, though, Engida is still writing most of the code himself.Better Auth, which just graduated from YC’s recent spring batch, is the third Ethiopian startup to pass through the accelerator, following drone-based digital health platform Avion, and food delivery platform BeU Delivery. “Building this feels important not just because people love the product, but because of what it represents,” said Engida. “There aren’t many Ethiopian founders building global products. For many, it feels almost impossible. So seeing that traction gives hope for other people to try to be more ambitious.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Should Prediction Markets Matter?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/QYbfAqvcX3A</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/QYbfAqvcX3A?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 18:00:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Why do prediction markets matter more than ever?

"For years, young people seeking a lucrative career were urged to go all in on computer science. From 2005 to 2023, the number of comp-sci majors in the United States quadrupled. All of which makes the latest batch of numbers so startling. This year, enrollment grew by only 0.2 percent nationally, and at many programs, it appears to already be in decline, according to interviews with professors and department chairs. At Stanford, widely considered one of the country's top programs, the number of comp-sci majors has stalled after years of blistering growth. Szymon Rusinkiewicz, the chair of Princeton's computer-science department, told me that, if current trends hold, the cohort of graduating comp-sci majors at Princeton is set to be 25 percent smaller in two years than it is today. The number of Duke students enrolled in introductory computer-science courses has dropped about 20 percent over the past year." 

"But if the decline is surprising, the reason for it is fairly straightforward: Young people are responding to a grim job outlook for entry-level coders. In recent years, the tech industry has been roiled by layoffs and hiring freezes. The leading culprit for the slowdown is technology itself. Artificial intelligence has proved to be even more valuable as a writer of computer code than as a writer of words. This means it is ideally suited to replacing the very type of person who built it. A recent Pew study found that Americans think software engineers will be most affected by generative AI. Many young people aren't waiting to find out whether that's true." 

Meanwhile, writing in the Communications of the ACM, Orit Hazzan and Avi Salmon ask: Should Universities Raise or Lower Admission Requirements for CS Programs in the Age of GenAI? "This debate raises a key dilemma: should universities raise admission standards for computer science programs to ensure that only highly skilled problem-solvers enter the field, lower them to fill the gaps left by those who now see computer science as obsolete due to GenAI, or restructure them to attract excellent candidates with diverse skill sets who may not have considered computer science prior to the rise of GenAI, but who now, with the intensive GenAI and vibe coding tools supporting programming tasks, may consider entering the field?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Build and Host AI-Powered Apps with Claude – No Deployment Needed</title><link>https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-powered-artifacts</link><author>davidbarker</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 17:14:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Today, we’re introducing the ability to build, host, and share interactive AI-powered apps directly in the Claude app. Now developers can iterate faster on their AI apps without worrying about the complexity and cost of scaling for a growing audience.Build and host Claude-powered appsHere’s what we built: Claude can now create artifacts that interact with Claude through an API— turning these artifacts into AI-powered apps, where the economics actually work for sharing.When someone uses your Claude-powered app:They authenticate with their existing Claude accountTheir API usage counts against  subscription, not yoursYou pay nothing for their usageNo one needs to manage API keysClaude writes real code that orchestrates complex AI functionality.

his congratulations. Feynman responded, asking Mr. Mano what he was now doing.
The response: “studying the Coherence theory with some applications to the
propagation of electromagnetic waves through turbulent atmosphere… a humble and
down-to-earth type of problem.”Dear Koichi,

I was very happy to hear from you, and that you have such a position in the
Research Laboratories. Unfortunately your letter made me unhappy for you seem
to be truly sad. It seems that the influence of your teacher has been to give
you a false idea of what are worthwhile problems. The worthwhile problems are
the ones you can really solve or help solve, the ones you can really contribute
something to. A problem is grand in science if it lies before us unsolved and
we see some way for us to make some headway into it. I would advise you to take
even simpler, or as you say, humbler, problems until you find some you can
really solve easily, no matter how trivial. You will get the pleasure of
success, and of helping your fellow man, even if it is only to answer a
question in the mind of a colleague less able than you. You must not take away
from yourself these pleasures because you have some erroneous idea of what is
worthwhile.

You met me at the peak of my career when I seemed to you to be concerned with
problems close to the gods. But at the same time I had another Ph.D. Student
(Albert Hibbs) was on how it is that the winds build up waves blowing over
water in the sea. I accepted him as a student because he came to me with the
problem he wanted to solve. With you I made a mistake, I gave you the problem
instead of letting you find your own; and left you with a wrong idea of what is
interesting or pleasant or important to work on (namely those problems you see
you may do something about). I am sorry, excuse me. I hope by this letter to
correct it a little.

I have worked on innumerable problems that you would call humble, but which I
enjoyed and felt very good about because I sometimes could partially succeed.
For example, experiments on the coefficient of friction on highly polished
surfaces, to try to learn something about how friction worked (failure). Or,
how elastic properties of crystals depends on the forces between the atoms in
them, or how to make electroplated metal stick to plastic objects (like radio
knobs). Or, how neutrons diffuse out of Uranium. Or, the reflection of
electromagnetic waves from films coating glass. The development of shock waves
in explosions. The design of a neutron counter. Why some elements capture
electrons from the L-orbits, but not the K-orbits. General theory of how to
fold paper to make a certain type of child’s toy (called flexagons). The energy
levels in the light nuclei. The theory of turbulence (I have spent several
years on it without success). Plus all the “grander” problems of quantum
theory.

No problem is too small or too trivial if we can really do something about it.

You say you are a nameless man. You are not to your wife and to your child. You
will not long remain so to your immediate colleagues if you can answer their
simple questions when they come into your office. You are not nameless to me.
Do not remain nameless to yourself – it is too sad a way to be. now your place
in the world and evaluate yourself fairly, not in terms of your naïve ideals of
your own youth, nor in terms of what you erroneously imagine your teacher’s
ideals are.

Best of luck and happiness.  Sincerely, Richard P. Feynman.

Against her husband's wishes, she trains to become a solar technician. In doing so, she initiates a shift in patriarchal traditions.

In the former Fulbe kingdom of "Fouta Toro” on the border between Senegal and Mauritania, there are villages so remote that the nearest town is several hours away by car. There is no connection to the electricity grid here. Néné lives in one of these villages. At the market, she heard about an NGO that gives women the opportunity to learn about solar energy. Néné decides to visit the NGO: Her village needs electricity.

Before Néné, no woman had ever left her village, attended school or learned anything other than how to feed animals, cultivate fields, look after children and prepare food. Néné's husband doesn't want to let her go, but she resists his wishes. She decides to train as a solar technician.

Néné is not alone - other women will be taking part in the training alongside her. As they board the minibus bound for the city, their first step into a new life begins. At the training center, they experience running water and electricity for the first time. The sea and the hustle and bustle of the big city are also new to them.

Four months later, the women return to the village, bringing with them much-desired know-how. They explain how the houses can be supplied with solar energy. Little by little, solar power is finding its way into people's everyday lives. Through their actions and their training, the women subtly raise questions about the meaning of modernity -- and the position of women in society.

From the filmmakers of "The Gene" and "Cancer: The Emperor of All Maladies," and Executive Produced by Bradley Cooper, "Caregiving" is a groundbreaking new documentary from Well Beings that personalizes America’s caregiving crisis. Featuring intimate stories and expert voices, the film highlights the struggles and triumphs of caregivers nationwide. 

The two-hour documentary is centered on the personal experiences of caregivers providing for loved ones, and the challenges and triumph they face each day. As the number of caregivers declines, and the number of individuals requiring care in our country increases, the challenges grow. Caregivers require differing types and levels of support. At times, the burdens of caregiving can seem unbearable, regardless of resources. The “needs gap” for information may be greater for caregivers than it is for care recipients. The film will explore these issues and shine a light on innovation for 21st century caregiving. Narrated by Award-winning actress Uzo Aduba.

Just speed up your audio.I mean that very literally. Run your audio through ffmpeg at 2x or 3x before transcribing it. You’ll spend fewer tokens and less time waiting with almost no drop in transcription quality.Here’s a script combining of all my favorite little toys and tricks to get the job. You’ll need yt-dlp, ffmpeg and llm installed.# Extract the audio from the video
yt-dlp -f 'bestaudio[ext=m4a]' --extract-audio --audio-format m4a -o 'video-audio.m4a' "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ" -k;

# Create a low-bitrate MP3 version at 3x speed
ffmpeg -i "video-audio.m4a" -filter:a "atempo=3.0" -ac 1 -b:a 64k video-audio-3x.mp3;

# Send it along to OpenAI for a transcription
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions \

# Get a nice little summary

cat video-transcript.txt | llm --system "Summarize the main points of this talk."
I just saved you time by jumping straight to the point, but read-on if you want more of a story about how I accidentally discovered this while trying to summarize a 40-minute talk from Andrej Karpathy.Also read-on if you’re wondering why I didn’t just use the built-in auto-transcription that YouTube provides, though the short answer there is easy: I’m sort of a doofus and thought—incorrectly—it wasn’t available. So I did things the hard way.I Just Wanted the TL;DW(atch)A former colleague of mine sent me this talk from Andrej Karpathy about how AI is changing software. I wasn’t familiar with Andrej, but saw he’d worked at Tesla. That coupled with the talk being part of a Y Combinator series and 40 minutes made me think “Ugh. Do I… really want to watch this? Another 'AI is changing everything' talk from the usual suspects, to the usual crowds?”If ever there were a use-case for dumping something into an LLM to get the gist of it and walk away, this felt like it. I respected the person who sent it to me though and wanted to do the noble thing: use AI to summarize the thing for me, blindly trust it and engage with the person pretending I had watched it.My first instinct was to pipe the transcript into an LLM and get the gist of it. This script is the one I would previously reach for to pull the auto-generated transcripts from YouTube:yt-dlp --all-subs --skip-download \
  --sub-format ttml/vtt/best \
  [url]
For some reason though, no subtitles were downloaded. I kept running into an error!Later, after some head-scratching and rereading the documentation, I realized my version (2025.04.03) was outdated.: Updating to the latest version (2025.06.09) fixed it, but for some reason I did not try this  going down a totally different rabbit hole. I guess I got this little write-up and exploration out of it though.If you care more about summarizing transcripts and less about the vagaries of audio-transcriptions and tokens, this is the correct answer and your off-ramp.My Transcription WorkflowI already had an old, home-brewed script that would extract the audio from any video URL, pipe it through whisper locally and dump the transcription in a text file.That worked, but I was on dwindling battery power in a coffee shop. Not ideal for longer, local inference, mighty as my M3 MacBook Air still feels to me. I figured I would try offloading it to OpenAI’s API instead. Surely that would be faster?Testing OpenAI’s Transcription ToolsOkay, using the  model it’s  pretty slow, but it gets the job done. Had I opted for the model I knew and moved on, the story might end here.However, out of curiosity, I went straight for the newer  model first. It’s built to handle multimodal inputs and promises faster responses.I quickly hit another roadblock: there’s a 25-minute audio limit and my audio was nearly 40 minutes long.Let's Try Something ObviousAt first I thought about trimming the audio to fit somehow, but there wasn’t an obvious 14 minutes to cut. Trimming the beginning and end would give me a minute or so at most.An interesting, weird idea I thought about for a second but never tried was cutting a chunk or two out of the middle. Maybe I would somehow still have enough info for a relevant summary?Then it crossed my mind—what if I just sped up the audio before sending it over? People listen to podcasts at accelerated 1-2x speeds all the time.ffmpeg -i video-audio.m4a -filter:a "atempo=2.0" -ac 1 -b:a 64k video-audio-2x.mp3
Ta-da! Now I had something closer to a 20 minute file to send to OpenAI.I uploaded it and… it worked like a charm! Behold the summary bestowed upon me that gave me enough confidence to reply to my colleague as though I had watched it.But there was something... interesting here. Did I just stumble across a sort of obvious, straightforward hack? Is everyone in the audio-transcription business already doing this and am I just haphazardly bumbling into their secrets?Why This Works: Our Brains Forgive, and So Does AIThere’s an interesting parallel here in my mind with optimizing images. Traditionally you have lossy and lossless file formats. A lossy file-format kind of gives away the game in its description—the further you crunch and compact the bytes the more fidelity you’re going to lose. It works because the human brain just isn’t likely to pick-up on the artifacts and imperfectionBut even with a “lossless” file format there are tricks you can lean into that rely on the limits of human perception. One of the primary ways you can do that with a PNG or GIF is reducing the number of unique colors in the palette. You’d be surprised by how often a palette of 64 colors or fewer might actually be enough and perceived as significantly more.There’s also a parallel in my head between this and the brain’s ability to still comprehend text with spelling mistakes, dropped words and other errors, i.e. transposed letter effects. Our brains have a knack for filling in the gaps, and when you go looking through the world with magnifying glass you'll start to notice lots of them.Speeding up the audio starts to drop the more subtle sounds and occasionally shorter words from the audio, but it doesn’t seem to hurt my ability to  what I’m hearing—even if I do have to focus. These audio transcription models seem to be pretty good at this as well.Wait—how far can I push this? Does It Actually Save Money?Turns out yes. OpenAI charges for transcription based on audio tokens, which scale with the duration of the input. Faster audio = fewer seconds = fewer tokens.Here are some rounded numbers based on the 40-minute audio file breaking down the audio input and text output token costs:That’s a solid 33% price reduction on input tokens at 3x! However the bulk of your costs for these transcription models are still going to be the output tokens. Those are priced at $10 per 1M tokens whereas audio input tokens are priced at $6 per 1M token as of the time of this writing.Also interesting to note—my output tokens for the 2x and 3x versions were exactly the same: 2,048. This kind of makes sense, I think? To the extent the output tokens are a reflection of that model's ability to understand and summarize the input, my takeaway is a “summarized” (i.e. reduced-token) version of the same audio yields the same amount of comprehensibility.This is also probably a reflection of the 4,096 token ceiling on transcriptions generally when using the  model. I suspect half the context window is reserved for the output tokens and this is basically reflecting our request using it up in its entirety. I suspect we might get diminishing results with longer transcriptions.So the back-of-the-envelope calculator for a single transcription looks something like this:6 * (audio_input_tokens / 1_000_000) + 10 * (text_output_tokens / 1_000_000);
That does  quite seem to jibe with the estimated cost of $0.006 per minute stated on the pricing page, at least for the 2x speed. That version (19-20 minutes) seemed to cost about $0.09 whereas the 3x version (13 minutes) cost about $0.07 (pretty accurate actually), if I’m adding up the tokens correctly.# Pricing for 2x speed
6 * (11_856 / 1_000_000) + 10 * (2_048 / 1_000_000) = 0.09

# Pricing for 3x speed
6 * (7_904 / 1_000_000) + 10 * (2_048 / 1_000_000) = 0.07
It would seem that estimate isn’t just based on the length of the audio but also some assumptions around how many tokens per minute are going to be generated from a normal speaking cadence.Comparing these costs to  is easy because the pricing table more confidently advertises the cost—not “estimated” cost—as a flat $0.006 per minute. I’m assuming that’s minute of audio processed, not minute of inference.The  model actually compares pretty favorably.In short, yes! It’s not particularly rigorous, but it seems like we reduced the cost of transcribing our 40-minute audio file by 23% from $0.09 to $0.07 simply by speeding up the audio.If we could compare to a 1x version of the audio file trimmed to the 25-minute limit, I bet we could paint an even more impressive picture of cost reduction. We kind of can with the  chart. You could make the case this technique reduced costs by 67%!I don’t know—I didn’t watch it, lol. That was the whole point. And if that answer makes you uncomfortable, buckle-up for this future we're hurtling toward. Boy, howdy.More helpfully, I didn’t compare word-for-word, but spot checks on the 2x and 3x versions looked solid. 4x speed was too fast—the transcription started getting hilariously weird. So, 2x and 3x seem to be the sweet spot between efficiency and fidelity, though it will obviously depend on how fast the people are speaking in the first place.That sure didn't stop my call to summarize from trying though.Hey, not the worst talk I've been to!Always, in short, to save time and money, consider doubling or tripling the speed of the audio you want to transcribe. The trade-off is, as always, fidelity, but it’s not an insignificant savings.Simple, fast, and surprisingly effective.OpenAI charges for transcriptions based on audio duration () or tokens ().You can  with  before uploading to save time and money.This reduces audio tokens (or duration), lowering your bill. works well.? Probably too much—but fun to try.If you find problems with my math, have questions, found a more rigorous study qualitatively comparing different output speeds please get in touch! Or if you thought this was so cool you want to hire me for something fun...--]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Gemini CLI</title><link>https://blog.google/technology/developers/introducing-gemini-cli-open-source-ai-agent/</link><author>sync</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 13:10:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

ABSTRACT
One of the most contentious words in technology culture today is “Architect.” I experience an endless stream of divisive, confusing opinions about what "architecture" means. At a conference, an attendee noticed that my badge said "architect" and told me "I want to be an architect too, but I don't know enough about Kubernetes yet".

Architecture, in the systems age, is not (just) Kubernetes. It's not the implementation of any particular toolset. Architecture is designing relationships between parts and adapting those relationship patterns as circumstances change. This requires engaging our mental models and working together to transform them.

The architecture skillset is socio-technical -- a blend of social and technology skills. It is a way of thinking and communicating. In the modern age, there is no division between the way we think together and the code running in production. Our thinking designs our architecture.

Architecture is structuring good systems thinking.

In this talk, I will admit that sometimes architecture is Kubernetes. And share five essential qualities that make a good architect a great architect, regardless of the toolset they employ. [...]

								The larger, outer triangle represents the colors that are typical with a High Dynamic Range (HDR) image.
							This new HDR support uses only 4 bytes (plus the usual PNG chunk overhead).Finally recognizes APNGs (animations!)Animated PNGs were proposed by Mozilla quite some time ago. Support was added to Firefox, but other programs hesitated to adopt them.Today, animated PNGs are widely supported. It is time for the spec to reflect reality.Officially supports Exif dataExif stores additional information such as copyright information and even camera lens and GPS location of a photograph.General tidying up—fixing errata, clarifications, etc.The last PNG spec was released over 20 years ago. Technology has advanced a lot since then. We're talking 3.5 years before the first iPhone.In fact, technological advancement is what resurrected PNG. The W3C Timed Text Working Group (think: subtitles) needed HDR support in PNG. A proposal was made, but a few experts decided we could do better.Momentum built, and additional parties became interested. Before we knew it, we had representation from (in alphabetical order) Adobe, Apple, BBC, Comcast / NBCUniversal, Google, MovieLabs, and of course W3C, who maintains the spec. It's quite the dream team.With these titans behind it, the image format is back with full momentum. Work has already begun on the  PNG spec updates.Many of the programs you use already support the new PNG spec: Chrome, Safari, Firefox, iOS/macOS, Photoshop, DaVinci Resolve, Avid Media Composer...Plus, you saw some broadcast companies in that list above. Behind the scenes, hardware and tooling are being updated to support the new PNG spec. The next time you see a news ticker scrolling  or the score banner update as your team pulls out a clutch play, check if it is HDR.I know you all immediately wondered, . We're already working on that. And parallel encoding/decoding, too! Just like this update, we want to make sure we do it right.We expect the next PNG update (Fourth Edition) to be short. It will improve HDR & Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) interoperability. While we work on that, we'll be researching compression updates for PNG Fifth Edition.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Former Btrfs Lead Developer Chris Mason Announces New &quot;rsched&quot; Tool</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/rsched</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 00:27:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Open-source Linux developer Chris Mason who is known for being the original lead developer of the Btrfs file-system recently began hacking on a new tool that he announced today, rsched...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Thnickels</title><link>https://thick-coins.net/?_bhlid=8a5736885893b7837e681aa73f890b9805a4673e</link><author>jxmorris12</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 00:13:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello this is Theodore Nichols and welcome to my world wide web page.

It is common practice to require the use of specific versions of the kernel, its configuration, device drivers, or system components.
Despite the existence of the Open Container Initiative (OCI), a governing community to define standards and specifications for container images, there has been a gap in expression of such compatibility requirements.
The need to address this issue has led to different proposals and, ultimately, an implementation in Kubernetes' Node Feature Discovery (NFD).NFD is an open source Kubernetes project that automatically detects and reports hardware and system features of cluster nodes. This information helps users to schedule workloads on nodes that meet specific system requirements, which is especially useful for applications with strict hardware or operating system dependencies.Dependencies between containers and host OSA container image is built on a base image, which provides a minimal runtime environment, often a stripped-down Linux userland, completely empty or distroless. When an application requires certain features from the host OS, compatibility issues arise. These dependencies can manifest in several ways::
Host driver versions must match the supported range of a library version inside the container to avoid compatibility problems. Examples include GPUs and network drivers.:
The container must come with a specific version or range of versions for a library or software to run optimally in the environment. Examples from high performance computing are MPI, EFA, or Infiniband.Kernel Modules or Features::
Specific kernel features or modules must be present. Examples include having support of write protected huge page faults, or the presence of VFIOWhile containers in Kubernetes are the most likely unit of abstraction for these needs, the definition of compatibility can extend further to include other container technologies such as Singularity and other OCI artifacts such as binaries from a spack binary cache.Multi-cloud and hybrid cloud challengesContainerized applications are deployed across various Kubernetes distributions and cloud providers, where different host operating systems introduce compatibility challenges.
Often those have to be pre-configured before workload deployment or are immutable.
For instance, different cloud providers will include different operating systems like:Each OS comes with unique kernel versions, configurations, and drivers, making compatibility a non-trivial issue for applications requiring specific features.
It must be possible to quickly assess a container for its suitability to run on any specific environment.An effort was made within the Open Containers Initiative Image Compatibility working group to introduce a standard for image compatibility metadata.
A specification for compatibility would allow container authors to declare required host OS features, making compatibility requirements discoverable and programmable.
The specification implemented in Kubernetes Node Feature Discovery is one of the discussed proposals.
It aims to:Define a structured way to express compatibility in OCI image manifests.Support a compatibility specification alongside container images in image registries.Allow automated validation of compatibility before scheduling containers.The concept has since been implemented in the Kubernetes Node Feature Discovery project.Implementation in Node Feature DiscoveryThe solution integrates compatibility metadata into Kubernetes via NFD features and the NodeFeatureGroup API.
This interface enables the user to match containers to nodes based on exposing features of hardware and software, allowing for intelligent scheduling and workload optimization.The compatibility specification is a structured list of compatibility objects containing .
These objects define image requirements and facilitate validation against host nodes.
The feature requirements are described by using the list of available features from the NFD project.
The schema has the following structure: (string) - Specifies the API version. (array of objects) - List of compatibility sets.
 (int, optional) - Node affinity weight. (string, optional) - Categorization tag. (string, optional) - Short description.An example might look like the following:Client implementation for node validationTo streamline compatibility validation, we implemented a client tool that allows for node validation based on an image's compatibility artifact.
In this workflow, the image author would generate a compatibility artifact that points to the image it describes in a registry via the referrers API.
When a need arises to assess the fit of an image to a host, the tool can discover the artifact and verify compatibility of an image to a node before deployment.
The client can validate nodes both inside and outside a Kubernetes cluster, extending the utility of the tool beyond the single Kubernetes use case.
In the future, image compatibility could play a crucial role in creating specific workload profiles based on image compatibility requirements, aiding in more efficient scheduling.
Additionally, it could potentially enable automatic node configuration to some extent, further optimizing resource allocation and ensuring seamless deployment of specialized workloads.Define image compatibility metadata
A container image can have metadata that describes its requirements based on features discovered from nodes, like kernel modules or CPU models.
The previous compatibility specification example in this article exemplified this use case.Attach the artifact to the image
The image compatibility specification is stored as an OCI artifact.
You can attach this metadata to your container image using the oras tool.
The registry only needs to support OCI artifacts, support for arbitrary types is not required.
Keep in mind that the container image and the artifact must be stored in the same registry.
Use the following command to attach the artifact to the image:Validate image compatibility
After attaching the compatibility specification, you can validate whether a node meets the image's requirements.
This validation can be done using the nfd client:nfd compat validate-node --image <image-url>Read the output from the client
Finally you can read the report generated by the tool or use your own tools to act based on the generated JSON report.The addition of image compatibility to Kubernetes through Node Feature Discovery underscores the growing importance of addressing compatibility in cloud native environments.
It is only a start, as further work is needed to integrate compatibility into scheduling of workloads within and outside of Kubernetes.
However, by integrating this feature into Kubernetes, mission-critical workloads can now define and validate host OS requirements more efficiently.
Moving forward, the adoption of compatibility metadata within Kubernetes ecosystems will significantly enhance the reliability and performance of specialized containerized applications, ensuring they meet the stringent requirements of industries like telecommunications, high-performance computing or any environment that requires special hardware or host OS configuration.Join the Kubernetes Node Feature Discovery project if you're interested in getting involved with the design and development of Image Compatibility API and tools.

It's now simple called "Edit." Ars Technica reports: 
Aside from ease of use, Microsoft's main reason for creating the new version of Edit stems from a peculiar gap in modern Windows. "What motivated us to build Edit was the need for a default CLI text editor in 64-bit versions of Windows," writes [Christopher Nguyen, a product manager on Microsoft's Windows Terminal team] while referring to the command-line interface, or CLI. "32-bit versions of Windows ship with the MS-DOS editor, but 64-bit versions do not have a CLI editor installed inbox." [...]
 
Linux users can download Edit from the project's GitHub releases page or install it through an unofficial snap package. Oh, and if you're a fan of the vintage editor and crave a 16-bit text-mode for your retro machine that actually runs MS-DOS, you can download a copy on the Internet Archive. [...]
 
At 250KB, the new Edit maintains the lightweight philosophy of its predecessor while adding features the original couldn't dream of: Unicode support, regular expressions, and the ability to handle gigabyte-sized files. The original editor was limited to files smaller than 300KB depending on available conventional memory -- a constraint that seems quaint in an era of terabyte storage. But the web publication OMG! Ubuntu found that the modern Edit not only "works great on Ubuntu" but noted its speed when handling gigabyte-sized documents.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Twins done did it again</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/moDcmhVHlq4</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/moDcmhVHlq4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 22:02:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The &quot;White Mouse&quot;: How Nancy Wake Became Gestapo&apos;s Most Wanted</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_zU3SPR9_8</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/I_zU3SPR9_8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 21:00:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[During World War II, Nancy Wake bravely fought against the Nazis in war-torn France.

The free update adds 4K visuals while docked and a rock-solid 60 frames per second for both docked and handheld play. After several hours of testing, I've found both Scarlet and Violet run and play  better.On the original Switch, a stormy Casseroya Lake in the northwestern part of Paldea was particularly taxing--even after a handful of updates, I dreaded going to that lake to collect items or shiny hunt. Now, on the Switch 2, it runs flawlessly regardless of where you are in the world. Additionally, the lengthy loading times have been reduced to a few seconds.Despite these improvements, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet still isn't the most visually appealing Pokemon game to date. The world feels bland and barren, and character models--outside of the wonderfully detailed and expressive Pokemon--are simplistic and wooden. Despite the 4k resolution, there are still plenty of low-quality textures and visual bugs can occur during battle. It's a shame given how strong the visual identity is for something like Pokemon Let's Go! Pikachu and Eevee or even Pokemon: Legends Arceus, which received a fair bit of criticism for its visuals as well.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fun with uv and PEP 723</title><link>https://www.cottongeeks.com/articles/2025-06-24-fun-with-uv-and-pep-723</link><author>deepakjois</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 18:41:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[For the longest time, I have been frustrated with Python because I couldn’t use it for one-off scripts. I had to first ensure it was running in an environment where it could find the right Python version and the dependencies installed. That is now a thing of the past.If you are not a Pythonista (or one possibly living under a rock), uv is an extremely fast Python package and project manager, written in Rust.uv also provides this nifty tool called  (kinda like  from the Node/NPM ecosystem for Javascript/Typescript packages) which can be used to invoke a Python tool inside a package.  takes care of creating a (cached) disposable virtual environment, setting up the right Python version and installing all the dependencies before running.PEP 723 is a Python Enhancement Proposal that specifies a metadata format that can be embedded in single-file Python scripts to assist launchers, IDEs and other external tools which may need to interact with such scripts.Here is the example directly lifted from the proposal:Combining uv and the PEP-723 metadata inside a Python script, we can run the script in the previous section as follows:We can combine things we covered in the previous sections to create a simple executable script that can extract YouTube transcripts.First we create a Python script with a shebang and inline metadata.Note the shebang line: #!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script. It is important to specify  with the  flag when used on the shebang line.We save this script as  and then make it executable with .We can now run the script like:This opens up a lot of possibilities for running Python code more seamlessly. Before this I used to prefer Go for one-off scripts because it was easy to create a self-contained binary executable. But now that I could use uv, I coded up a quick MCP server in Python for extracting YouTube transcripts.

Mads was travelling to the States to visit friends, first in New York and then in Austin, Texas, but suffered "harassment and abuse of power" at the hands of US immigration authorities."I felt prejudiced, suspected and simply humiliated even then, in front of many other people at the airport," The Tromsø native recounted. "They took me to a room with several armed guards, where I had to hand over my shoes, mobile phone and backpack."Officers quizzed Mads about his visit, and his plans, before adopting a personal line of questioning. "They asked direct questions about drug smuggling, terrorist plans and right-wing extremism, completely without reason," he claimed."They demanded full information about everyone I was going to meet in the US, including name, address, phone number and what they did for work." Mads' mother was due to meet up with him a few weeks into his stay and the pair had planned to travel to several national parks."I had travelled for twelve hours, slept poorly, and was physically and mentally completely exhausted even before they started the questioning," he continued. A strenuous crackdown by U.S. Customs and Border Protection has followed President Donald Trump's return to office, with the service being allowed to search phones.A French scientist was denied entry at the border earlier this year, in March, after officers unearthed messages criticising Trump on his phone. Mikkelsen explained: "They threatened me with a minimum fine of $5,000 or five years in prison if I refused to provide the password to my phone."After handing over his password, Mads was told he would not be allowed to go through with his planned vacation after two images were not to the officers' liking. One image was of a meme showcasing JD Vance with a bald, egg-shaped head. Variations of the image were shared endlessly in March on social media, with the Vice President himself posting his own version.The other picture showed Mads with a wooden pipe which he had made years prior. "Both pictures had been automatically saved to my camera roll from a chat app, but I really didn't think that these innocent pictures would put a stop to my entry into the country," the 21-year-old admitted.Mads told Nordlys he tried to explain the images as being harmless and meant as jokes but the immigration authorities ignored his pleas. He claims he was then strip-searched, forced to give blood samples, a facial scan and fingerprints."Later I was taken back in, and the situation got even worse. I was pushed up against a wall and was strip-searched with a lot of force. They were incredibly harsh and used physical force the whole time," he claimed."I felt completely devastated and broke down, and was close to crying several times. I was on the verge of panic. It felt like I was a terrorist suspect where I was sitting. I tried to pull myself together several times, but in the end, I just wanted to get home again."The Norwegian adds he was placed in a cell for a further five hours, refused food or water and placed on a plane back to Oslo the same day he arrived for the holiday of a lifetime. "I don't feel there is any point in contacting the State Department, nor do I think they have any power against such a powerful and strict country as the United States," Mads conceded.Mathias Rongved, a spokesperson at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has warned fellow Norwegians that it is their duty to be clued up on US regulations before entering the country. "Most trips to the US go without any particular problems," he said."Entry regulations can change at short notice, and it is the traveller's responsibility to have valid documents and be familiar with the current entry regulations. It is the immigration authorities upon arrival who decide whether you are rejected at the border. Norwegian authorities cannot intervene in this decision."It is also not necessarily the case that we receive a message either from other countries' border authorities or the Norwegian traveller if the person in question is not allowed to enter a country."Join our Dublin Live breaking news service on WhatsApp. Clickto receive your daily dose of Dublin Live content.

With Lara Anderson</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fplTT3IrxDw</link><author>StarTalk</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/fplTT3IrxDw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 18:20:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoAEDirJPjEUFcF2FklnBA">StarTalk</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[What is string theory, really? Why does it need extra dimensions? Neil deGrasse Tyson and comedian Chuck Nice welcome theoretical physicist and mathematician Lara Anderson to guide us through string theory, higher dimensions, and finding a unifying theory of everything.

Could it be the long-sought bridge between quantum mechanics and Einstein’s theory of gravity? We explore the problem between relativity and quantum physics, and why things break down when combined. Could strings be the key to unifying these two frameworks? How do strings explain particles? And if they’re so small we can’t detect them, how can we confirm the theory?

Have we reached a fundamental particle yet? Lara walks us through the geometry of hidden additional dimensions and how to get around untestable theories. Learn about the math behind string theory and the vision Chuck had about the dimensionality of the universe. Can you have two time dimensions? Or a compactified time dimension? Discover how there are an infinite number of quantum theories for not our universe and what it means to consider a spherical cow. Can string theory produce the particle physics we see? 

We tackle string theory skepticism, the “string landscape,” and the unexpected discoveries made along the way, like the holographic principle to dualities that link seemingly unrelated theories. What does it mean when two different geometries produce the same physics? And is string theory actually connected to the physics we observe? Can AI help us navigate the math? Plus, we discuss the topology of knots and why you can tie a knot in four dimensions. Could string theory be the gateway to new physics?

The conflict in Ukraine has shown that warfare is changing. Can the German armed forces keep up?

New weaponry is being developed: from drones to artificial intelligence and automatic missile defense systems. Germany’s military, the Bundeswehr, is rearming on a large scale while assessing its future priorities. For example, are expensive tanks still suitable for battle when they can be destroyed by cheap drones? And what future role will multi-million-euro fighter planes play?
Analysts say that Russia will be in a position to attack NATO territory in five to eight years' time. That’s led high-ranking German military officials to call for the country to be sufficiently armed by 2029. But how realistic is that goal?

Another concern is the risk of collateral damage caused by the misjudgments of artificial intelligence. Previously, it was hoped that modern weapons like drones would require fewer soldiers on the frontlines. But experts now believe these more complicated weapons will require more maintenance and therefore more personnel. According to military experts, modern warfare will ironically demand more soldiers than before.

How are Germany, NATO and Russia positioned militarily? Who is spending vast sums on which technologies? And just how much weaponry is actually sensible or justifiable?

definition of ‘create’). It is to this principle that I believe I owe everything I’m truly good at. Some will tell you
to avoid reinventing the wheel, but they’re wrong: you  build your own wheel, because it’ll teach you more about
how they work than reading a thousand books on them ever will.In 2025, the beauty and craft of writing software is being eroded. AI is threatening to replace us (or, at least, the
most joyful aspects of our craft) and software development is being increasingly commodified, measured, packaged, and
industrialised. Software development needs more simple joy, and I’ve found that creating toy programs is a great way to
remember why I started working with computers again.Toy programs follow the 80:20 rule: 20% of the work, 80% of the functionality. The point is  to build
production-worthy software (although it is true that some of the best production software began life as a toy).
Aggressively avoid over-engineering, restrict yourself to only whatever code is necessary to achieve your goal. Have
every code path panic/crash until you’re forced to implement it to make progress. You might be surprised by just how
easy it is to build toy versions of software you might previously have considered to be insummountably difficult to
create.I’ve been consistently surprised by just how often some arcane nugget of knowledge I’ve acquired when working on a toy
project has turned out to be immensely valuable in my day job, either by giving me a head-start on tracking down a
problem in a tool or library, or by recognising mistakes before they’re made.Understanding the constraints that define the shape of software is vital for working with it, and there’s no better way
to gain insight into those constraints than by running into them head-first. You might even come up with some novel
solutions!Here is a list of toy programs I’ve attempted over the past 15 years, rated by difficulty and time required. These
ratings are estimates and assume that you’re already comfortable with at least one general-purpose programming language
and that, like me, you tend to only have an hour or two per day free to write code. Also included are some suggested
resources that I found useful.Regex engine (difficulty = 4/10, time = 5 days)A regex engine that can read a POSIX-style regex program and recognise strings that match it. Regex is simple yet
shockingly expressive, and writing a competent regex engine will teach you everything you need to know about using the
language too.x86 OS kernel (difficulty = 7/10, time = 2 months)A multiboot-compatible OS kernel with a simple CLI, keyboard/mouse driver, ANSI escape sequence support, memory manager,
scheduler, etc. Additional challenges include writing an in-memory filesystem, user mode and process isolation, loading
ELF executables, and supporting enough video hardware to render a GUI.GameBoy/NES emulator (difficulty = 6/10, time = 3 weeks)A crude emulator for the simplest GameBoy or NES games. The GB and the NES are classics, and both have relatively simple
instruction sets and peripheral hardware. Additional challenges include writing competent PPU (video) and PSG (audio)
implementations, along with dealing with some of the more exotic cartridge formats.GameBoy Advance game (difficulty = 3/10, time = 2 weeks)A sprite-based game (top-down or side-on platform). The GBA is a beautiful little console to write code for and there’s
an active and dedicated development community for the console. I truly believe that the GBA is one of the last game
consoles that can be fully and completely understood by a single developer, right down to instruction timings.Physics engine (difficulty = 5/10, time = 1 week)A 2D rigid body physics engine that implements Newtonian physics with support for rectangles, circles, etc. On the
simplest end, just spheres that push away from one-another is quite simple to implement. Things start to get complex
when you introduce more complex shapes, angular momentum, and the like. Additional challenges include making collision
resolution fast and scaleable, having complex interactions move toward a steady state over time, soft-body interactions,
etc.Dynamic interpreter (difficulty = 4/10, time = 1-2 weeks)A tree-walking interpreter for a JavaScript-like language with basic flow control. There’s an unbounded list of extra
things to add to this one, but being able to write programs in my own language still gives me child-like elation. It
feels like a sort of techno-genesis: once you’ve got your own language, you can start building the universe within it.Compiler for a C-like (difficulty = 8/10, time = 3 months)A compiler for a simply-typed C-like programming language with support for at least one target archtecture. Extra
challenges include implementing some of the most common optimisations (inlining, const folding, loop-invariant code
motion, etc.) and designing an intermediate representation (IR) that’s general enough to support multiple backends.Text editor (difficulty = 5/10, time = 2-4 weeks)This one has a lot of variability. At the blunt end, simply reading and writing a file can be done in a few lines of
Python. But building something that’s closer to a daily driver gets more complex. You could choose to implement the UI
using a toolkit like QT or GTK, but I personally favour an editor that works in the console. Properly handling unicode,
syntax highlighting, cursor movement, multi-buffer support, panes/windows, tabs, search/find functionality, LSP support,
etc. can all add between a week or a month to the project. But if you persist, you might join the elite company of those
developers who use an editor of their own creation.Async runtime (difficulty = 6/10, time = 1 week)There’s a lot of language-specific variability as to what ‘async’ actually means. In Rust, at least, this means a
library that can ingest  tasks and poll them concurrently until completion. Adding support for I/O waking
makes for a fun challenge.Hash map (difficulty = 4/10, time = 3-5 days)Hash maps (or sets/dictionaries, as a higher-level language might call them) are a programmer’s bread & butter. And yet,
surprisingly few of us understand how they really work under the bonnet. There are a plethora of techniques to throw
into the mix too: closed or open addressing, tombstones, the robin hood rule, etc. You’ll gain an appreciation for when
and why they’re fast, and also when you should just use a vector + linear search.Rasteriser / texture-mapper (difficulty = 6/10, time = 2 weeks)Most of us have played with simple 3D graphics at some point, but how many of us truly understand how the graphics
pipeline works and, more to the point, how to fix it when it doesn’t work? Writing your own software rasteriser will
give you that knowledge, along with a new-found appreciation for the beauty of vector maths and half-spaces that have
applications across many other fields. Additional complexity involves properly implementing clipping, a Z-buffer, N-gon
rasterisation, perspective-correct texture-mapping, Phong or Gouraud shading, shadow-mapping, etc.SDF Rendering (difficulty = 5/10, time = 3 days)Signed Distance Fields are a beautifully simple way to render 3D spaces defined through mathematics, and are perfectly
suited to demoscene shaders. With relatively little work you can build yourself a cute little visualisation or some
moving shapes like the graphics demos of the 80s. You’ll also gain an appreciation for shader languages and vector
maths.Voxel engine (difficulty = 5/10, time = 2 weeks)I doubt there are many reading this that haven’t played Minecraft. It’s surprisingly easy to build your own toy voxel
engine cut from a similar cloth, especially if you’ve got some knowledge of 3D graphics or game development already. The
simplicity of a voxel engine, combined with the near-limitless creativity that can be expressed with them, never ceases
to fill me with joy. Additional complexity can be added by tackling textures, more complex procedural generation,
floodfill lighting, collisions, dynamic fluids, sending voxel data over the network, etc.Threaded Virtual Machine (difficulty = 6/10, time = 1 week)Writing interpreters is great fun. What’s more fun? . If you keep pushing interpreters as far as
they can go without doing architecture-specific codegen (like AOT or JIT), you’ll eventually wind up (re)discovering
 (not to be confused with multi-threading, which is a very different beast). It’s a beautiful way of
weaving programs together out highly-optimised miniature programs, and a decent implementation can even give an AOT
compiler a run for its money in the performance department.GUI Toolkit (difficulty = 6/10, time = 2-3 weeks)Most of us have probably cobbled together a GUI program using tkinter, GTK, QT, or WinForms. But why not try writing
your GUI toolkit? Additional complexity involves implementing a competent layout engine, good text shaping (inc.
unicode support), accessibility support, and more. Fair warning: do not encourage people to use your tool unless it’s
 - the world has enough GUIs with little-to-no accessibility or localisation support.Orbital Mechanics Sim (difficulty = 6/10, time = 1 week)A simple simulation of Newtonian gravity can be cobbled together in a fairly short time. Infamously, gravitational
systems with more than two bodies cannot be solved analytically, so you’ll have to get familiar with iterative
 methods. Additional complexity comes with implementing more precise and faster integration methods,
accounting for relativistic effects, and writing a visualiser. If you’ve got the maths right, you can even try plugging
in real numbers from NASA to predict the next high tide or full moon.Bitwise Challenge (difficulty = 3/10, time = 2-3 days)Here’s one I came up with for myself, but I think it would make for a great game jam: write a game that only persists 64
bits of state between subsequent frames. That’s 64 bits for everything: the entire frame-for-frame game state should be
reproducible using only 64 bits of data. It sounds simple, but it forces you to get incredibly creative with your game
state management. Details about the rules can be found on the GitHub page below.An ECS Framework (difficulty = 4/10, time = 1-2 weeks)For all those game devs out there: try building your own ECS
framework. It’s not as hard as you might think (you might have accidentally done it already!). Extra points if you can
build in safety and correctness features, as well as good integration with your programming language of choice’s type
system features.I built a custom ECS for my Super Mario 64 on the GBA project due to the
unique performance and memory constraints of the platform, and enjoyed it a lot.CHIP-8 Emulator (difficulty = 3/10, time = 3-6 days)The CHIP-8 is a beautifully simple virtual machine from the 70s. You can write
a fully compliant emulator in a day or two, and there are an enormous plethora of fan-made games that run on it.
Here’s a game I made for it.Chess engine (difficulty = 5/10, time = 2-5 days)Writing a chess engine is great fun. You’ll start off with every move it makes being illegal, but over time it’ll get
smart and smarter. Experiencing a loss to your own chess engine really is a rite of passage, and it feels magical.POSIX shell (difficulty = 4/10, time = 3-5 days)We interact with shells every day, and building one will teach you can incredible amount about POSIX - how it works, and
how it doesn’t. A simple one can be built in a day, but compliance with an existing shell language will take time and
teach you more than you ever wanted to know about its quirks.A note on learning and LLMsPerhaps you’re a user of LLMs. I get it, they’re neat tools. They’re useful for certain kinds of learning. But I might
suggest resisting the temptation to use them for projects like this. Knowledge is not supposed to be fed to you on a
plate. If you want that sort of learning, read a book - the joy in building toy projects like this comes from an
exploration of the unknown, without polluting one’s mind with an existing solution. If you’ve been using LLMs for a
while, this cold-turkey approach might even be painful at first, but persist. There is no joy without pain.The runner’s high doesn’t come to those that take the bus.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The physics behind Einstein’s most famous equation - Lindsay DeMarchi and Fabio Pacucci</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkTVlYDB21g</link><author>TED-Ed</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/gkTVlYDB21g?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 15:01:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA">TED-Ed</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Learn more at https://brilliant.org/TedEd

Ever since Einstein published his Special Theory of Relativity, one equation has been the bane of humans hoping to explore the stars: E=mc². In addition to informing our understanding of gravity, space, and time, this formula implies that traveling at or beyond light speed is impossible. Why is that? Lindsay DeMarchi and Fabio Pacucci explain the physics behind this unbreakable speed limit.

The entire project is open-source:  - electronics: designed in KiCad
  - 3D models: designed in CadQuery
  - software: written in Rust

I initially started this project during COVID and built a working prototype using a Raspberry Pi and off-the-shelf parts. The first prototype worked, but was pretty rough. Several months ago, I picked up the project again and began a complete re-design. After two rounds of circuit board design and countless iterations of the 3D-printed parts, I'm finally happy with the results. Along the way I learned a lot about electronics design and fabrication, 3D modeling, and Rust.Happy to answer any questions - thanks for checking it out!Here are some direct links to parts of the project you may find interesting:  - demo video: https://oasis-terrarium.com

      think the appearance of LLMs will change software development to a similar
      degree as the change from assembler to the first high-level programming
      languages. The further development of languages and frameworks increased
      our abstraction level and productivity, but didn’t have that kind of
      impact on the nature of programming. LLMs are making that degree of

								Figure 1 shows the colors our eyes can see.

								The larger, outer triangle represents the colors that are typical with a High Dynamic Range (HDR) image.
							This new HDR support uses only 4 bytes (plus the usual PNG chunk overhead).Finally recognizes APNGs (animations!)Animated PNGs were proposed by Mozilla quite some time ago. Support was added to Firefox, but other programs hesitated to adopt them.Today, animated PNGs are widely supported. It is time for the spec to reflect reality.Officially supports Exif dataExif stores additional information such as copyright information and even camera lens and GPS location of a photograph.General tidying up—fixing errata, clarifications, etc.The last PNG spec was released over 20 years ago. Technology has advanced a lot since then. We're talking 3.5 years before the first iPhone.In fact, technological advancement is what resurrected PNG. The W3C Timed Text Working Group (think: subtitles) needed HDR support in PNG. A proposal was made, but a few experts decided we could do better.Momentum built, and additional parties became interested. Before we knew it, we had representation from (in alphabetical order) Adobe, Apple, BBC, Comcast / NBCUniversal, Google, MovieLabs, and of course W3C, who maintains the spec. It's quite the dream team.With these titans behind it, the image format is back with full momentum. Work has already begun on the  PNG spec updates.Many of the programs you use already support the new PNG spec: Chrome, Safari, Firefox, iOS/macOS, Photoshop, DaVinci Resolve, Avid Media Composer...Plus, you saw some broadcast companies in that list above. Behind the scenes, hardware and tooling are being updated to support the new PNG spec. The next time you see a news ticker scrolling  or the score banner update as your team pulls out a clutch play, check if it is HDR.I know you all immediately wondered, . We're already working on that. And parallel encoding/decoding, too! Just like this update, we want to make sure we do it right.We expect the next PNG update (Fourth Edition) to be short. It will improve HDR & Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) interoperability. While we work on that, we'll be researching compression updates for PNG Fifth Edition.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Autumn – Open-source infra over Stripe</title><link>https://github.com/useautumn/autumn</link><author>ayushrodrigues</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 12:48:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey HN, I’m Ayush from Autumn (https://useautumn.com/). Autumn is an open source layer over Stripe that decouples pricing and billing logic from your application. We let you efficiently manage pricing plans, feature permissions, and payments, regardless of the pricing model being used. It’s a bit like if Supabase and Stripe had a baby.Typically, you have to write code to handle checkouts, upgrades/downgrades, failed payments, then receive webhooks to provision features, reset usage limits etc. We abstract this into one function call for all payments flows (checkouts, upgrades, downgrades etc), one function to record usage (so we can track usage limits), and a customer state React hook you can access from your frontend (to handle paywalls, display usage data etc).Stripe’s great! But there are 2 main reasons people use Autumn over a direct Stripe setup:(1) Billing infra can get complex. After payments, there’s still handling webhooks, permission management, metering, usage resets, and connecting them all to upgrade, downgrade, cancellation and failed payments states.(2) Growing companies iterate on pricing often: raising prices, experimenting with credits or charging for new features, etc. We save you from having to handle usage-based limits (super common in pricing today), rebuilding in-app flows, DB migrations, internal dashboards for custom pricing, and grandfathering users on different pricing.Ripping out billing flows etc, really sucks. With Autumn, you just make pricing changes in our UI and it all auto-updates. We have a shadcn/ui component library that helps with this.Because we support a lot of different pricing models (subscriptions, usage, credits, seat based etc), we have to handle a lot of different scenarios and cases under the hood. We try to keep setup simple while maintaining flexibility of a native integration. Here’s a little snippet of the architecture of our main endpoint: https://useautumn.com/blog/attachCurrently, the users who get the most value out of us are founders that need to move fast and keep things flexible, but also new/non-technical devs that are more AI native.We’d love to hear your feedback and how we could make it better!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Intel Compute Runtime 25.22.33944.8 Continues Baking Panther Lake, More Optimizations</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Intel-Compute-Runtime-June-2025</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 12:44:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Building off this morning's release of the Intel Graphics Compiler 2.12.5 is now the updated Intel Compute Runtime 25.22.33944.8 as their June 2025 feature release...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Elm &amp; Open Source: What&apos;s Next? • Evan Czaplicki &amp; Kris Jenkins • GOTO 2024</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdpAjDDh-c</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ABdpAjDDh-c?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 12:00:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This interview was recorded at GOTO Copenhagen 2024. #GOTOcon #GOTOcph

But that's precisely what the French developer has crafted with Rematch: a football game that embodies the spirit and chaotic energy of having a kick-about with friends. From the wayward passes and the goalkeeper who decides he's now a striker, to someone popping up with an incredible goal out of absolutely nowhere, Rematch constantly reminded me of my childhood and the countless hours spent playing football. When I was at school, I would forego food just so I could play for the entire hour-long lunchtime; when I was off school, I would inevitably get together with friends and head down to the local park, using jumpers as makeshift goalposts. Other games have done this kind of five-a-side style of football before, but none have come as close as Rematch does to capturing the essence of my footballing heyday.Rather than taking control of an entire team, Rematch puts you in the boots of a single player in 3v3, 4v4, and 5v5 matches. There's a short prologue and some training minigames to play on your own, but beyond this you're always playing with and against other human players. Each match lasts six minutes, and there's a mercy rule that immediately ends the game after one team has taken a four-goal lead (I guess Sloclap never saw Newcastle vs. Arsenal circa 2011). The only stoppages occur when a team scores; otherwise, Rematch plays fast and loose with the rules. There are no fouls, offsides, or handballs, and throw-ins, corners, and goal kicks are nonexistent due to the pitch being surrounded on all four sides by giant transparent walls. This quickly establishes a chaotic pace. Sometimes it's messy, while other times you feel like Messi. There's also no progression or skill points to help improve your player's attributes. Everyone is on a level playing field, so only the most skillful will rise to the top.There's a fairly steep learning curve to overcome in Rematch. Part of this derives from its tactile, physics-based design, which, among other things, prevents the ball from sticking to your feet when sprinting down the field. Another part is related to the game's perspective. In EA Sports FC, for instance, there's a camera option that follows closely behind your player in either Pro Clubs or its player career mode. I've never known anyone to actually use this view, though, as being able to see the full pitch from the classic sideline angle is much more effective. Rematch doesn't give you this option. You have full camera control, similar to most third-person games, but it's always positioned just behind your player, placing you directly in the thick of the action. The presence of a mini-map ensures that you don't need to have your head on a swivel like a Premier League midfielder, but it's still an uncommon way of playing a football game. Couple this with an enclosed playing field and futuristic stadiums, and there's more than a little Rocket League about Rematch. If Rocket League is football with cars, then Rematch is Rocket League without them.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump Lauds ‘Bullseye’ Strikes on Iran.

Some celebrate nationalist Karol Nawrocki; others fear setbacks on LGBTQ rights and abortion.

Last autumn, euphoria swept through Poland: Donald Tusk had won the parliamentary election, unseating the right-wing populist government after eight years. Poland showed what was possible - a shift away from nationalism to a more progressive society. But now, populist candidate Karol Nawrocki is changing that. After a surprise win in the presidential election, Nawrocki vowed to make life difficult for the liberal government.

Rubin Observatory’s cosmic treasure chest, a wealth of data that will help scientists make countless new discoveries about our Universe. This image, one of the first released by Rubin Observatory, exposes a Universe teeming with stars and galaxies — transforming seemingly empty, inky-black pockets of space into glittering tapestries for the first time. Only Rubin can quickly produce such large images with this much color and richness.Here, Rubin’s view is focused on the southern region of the , about 55 million light-years away from Earth and the nearest large collection of galaxies to our own Milky Way. The image offers a stunning variety of objects — from bright stars ranging from blue to red in color, to nearby blue spiral galaxies, to distant red galaxy groups — demonstrating the broad range of science made possible by Rubin data.During the 10-year Legacy Survey of Space and Time, scientists around the world will access Rubin’s treasure trove of data to address questions like: How did the Milky Way form? What makes up the 95% of the Universe we can’t see? What will a detailed inventory of Solar System objects reveal? What will we learn from watching hundreds of millions of changes in the night sky over 10 years?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How I use my terminal</title><link>https://jyn.dev/how-i-use-my-terminal/</link><author>todsacerdoti</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 15:14:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[this is a whole blog post because it is "outside the overton window"; it usually takes at least a video before people even understand the thing i am trying to describe. so, here's the video:the steps here that tend to surprise people are 
, 
, and 
. when i say "surprise" i don't just mean that people are surprised that i've set this up, but they are surprised this is possible at all.here's what happens in that video:
 I start with Windows Terminal open on my laptop.
 I hit , which opens a new terminal tab which 's to my home desktop and immediately launches tmux.
 tmux launches my default shell, . zsh shows a prompt, while loading the full config asynchronously
 i use  to fuzzy find a recent directory
 i start typing a ripgrep command. zsh autofills the command since i've typed it before and i accept it with .
 i hit , which tells tmux to search all output in the scrollback for filenames. the filenames are highlighted in blue.
 i hold  to navigate through the files. there are a lot of them, so it takes me a bit to find the one i'm looking for.
 i press  to open the selected file in my default application (). tmux launches it in a new pane. note that this is still running ; it is opening a remote file in a remote tmux pane. i do not need to have this codebase cloned locally on my laptop.
 i try to navigate to several references using rust-analyzer, which fails because RA doesn't understand the macros in this file. at 
 i finally find one which works and navigate to it.
 i hit , which tells tmux to switch focus back to the left pane.
 i hit  again. the pane is still in "copy-mode", so all the files from before are still the focus of the search. they are highlighted again and tmux selects the next file in search order.
 i hit , which opens a different file than before, but in the  instance of .
 i hit , which shows my open file buffers. in particular, this shows that the earlier file is still open. i switch back and forth between the two files a couple times before ending the stream.i got annoyed at VSCode a while back for being laggy, especially when the vim plugin was running, and at having lots of keybind conflicts between the editor, vim plugin, terminal, and window management. i tried zed but at the time it was quite immature (and still had the problem of lots of keybind conflicts).i switched to using nvim in the terminal, but quickly got annoyed at how much time i spent copy-pasting filenames into the editor; in particular i would often copy-paste files with columns from ripgrep, get a syntax error, and then have to edit them before actually opening the file. this was quite annoying. what i wanted was an equivalent of ctrl-click in vscode, where i could take an arbitrary file path and have it open as smoothly as i could navigate to it. so, i started using tmux and built it myself.people sometimes ask me why i use tmux. this is why! this is the whole reason! (well, this and session persistence.) terminals are stupidly powerful and most of them expose almost none of it to you as the user. i like tmux, despite its age, bugs, and antiquated syntax, because it's very extensible in this way.this is done purely with tmux config:and this is the contents of :i will not go through the whole regex, but uh. there you go. i spent more time on this than i probably should have.this is actually a trick; there are many steps here.this part is not so bad. tmux again.i also have a version that always opens an editor in the current pane, instead of launching in the default application. for example i use  by default to view json files, but  to edit them.here is the trick. i have created a shell script (actually a perl script) that is the default application for all text files.setting up that many file associations by hand is a pain. i will write a separate blog post about the scripts that install my dotfiles onto a system. i don't use Nix partly because all my friends who use Nix have  bugs than they already had, and partly because i don't like the philosophy of not being able to install things at runtime. i want to install things at runtime and  that i did so. that's a separate post too.the relevant part is this:this bounces  to tmux. in particular, this is being very dumb and assuming that tmux is running on the machine where the file is, which happens to be the case here. this is not too bad to ensure - i just use a separate terminal  tab for each instance of tmux i care about; for example i will often have open one Windows Terminal tab for WSL on my local laptop, one for my desktop, and one for a remote work machine via a VPN.there's actually even more going on here—for example i am translating the  syntax to something vim understands, and overriding  so that it doesn't error out on the —but for the most part it's straightforward and not that interesting.this is a perl script that scripts tmux to send keys to a running instance of nvim (actually the same perl script as before, so that both of these can be bound to the same keybind regardless of whether nvim is already open or not):i don't need a fancy terminal locally; something with nice fonts is enough. all the fancy things are done through tmux, which is good because it means they work on Windows too without needing to install a separate terminal.the editor thing works even if the editor doesn't support remote scripting. nvim  support RPC, but this setup also worked back when i used  and .i  have written this such that the fancy terminal emulator scripts were in my editor, not in tmux (e.g.  in nvim). but again this locks me into the editor; and the built-in terminals in editors are usually not very good.well. well. now that you mention it. the last thing keeping me on tmux was session persistence and Ansuz has just released a standalone tool that does persistence and nothing else. so. i plan to switch to kitty in the near future, which lets me keep all these scripts and does not require shoving a whole second terminal emulator inside my terminal emulator, which hopefully will reduce the number of weird mysterious bugs i encounter on a regular basis.the reason i picked kitty over wezterm is that ssh integration works by integrating with the shell, not by launching a server process, so it doesn't need to be installed on the remote. this mattered less for tmux because tmux is everywhere, but hardly anywhere has wezterm installed by default.honestly, yeah. i spend quite a lot less time fighting my editor these days.it's  easier to debug when something goes wrong (vscode's debugging tools are mostly for plugin extension authors and running them is non-trivial). with vim plugins i can just add  statements to the lua source and see what's happening.all my keybinds make sense to me!my terminal is much easier to script through tmux than through writing a VSCode plugin, which usually involves setting up a whole typescript toolchain and context-switching into a new projectthat said, i cannot in good conscience recommend this to anyone else. all my scripts are fragile and will probably break if you look at them wrong, which is not ideal if you haven't written them yourself and don't know where to start debugging them.if you do want something similar without writing your own tools, i can recommend:fish + zoxide + fzf. that gets you steps 4, 5, and kinda sorta-ish 6."builtin functionality in your editor" - fuzzy find, full text search, tabs and windows, and "open recent file" are all commonly supported.qf, which gets you the "select files in terminal output" part of 6, kinda. you have to remember to pipe your output to it though, so it doesn't work after the fact and it doesn't work if your tool is interactive. note that it hard-codes a vi-like CLI (), so you may need to fork it or still add a script that takes the place of $EDITOR. see julia evans' most recent post for more info.e, which gets you the "translate  into something your editor recognizes" part of 8, kinda. i had never heard of this tool until i wrote my own with literally the exactly the same name that did literally exactly the same thing, forgot to put it in PATH, and got a suggestion from  asking if i wanted to install it, lol. or  or , all of which get you 12, kinda. the problem with this is that they don't all support , and it means you have to modify this whenever you switch editors. admittedly most people don't switch editors that often, lol.terminals are a lot more powerful than people think! by using terminals that let you script them, you can do quite a lot of things.you can kinda sorta replicate most of these features without scripting your terminal, as long as you don't mind tying yourself to an editor.doing this requires quite a lot of work, because no one who builds these tools thought of these features ahead of time.hopefully this was interesting! i am always curious what tools people use and how - feel free to email me about your own setup :)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Richard Swinburne on Dualism and Free Will | Closer To Truth Chats</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zikxubrbdaQ</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/zikxubrbdaQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 15:01:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Contribute what you can to help Closer To Truth continue exploring the world's deepest questions without the need for paywalls: https://closertotruth.com/donate/

Death Stranding's absurd nature, encompassing everything from urine grenades to gently rocking your controller to calm a distressed baby, was coupled with a rich new setting to unravel. Step by step, Sam Porter Bridges connected a post-apocalyptic America to a network by making dozens of deliveries from one point to another. Its slow and methodical pace made it somewhat of an outlier in the AAA space. The sequel follows suit in most ways that made its predecessor stand out. The core foundation remains unchanged--planning and executing each delivery requires strategy and improvisation, and they're still satisfying to pull off. But this second iteration doesn't feel as arresting as it mired in familiar story beats, a disappointing lack of friction, and an obsession with doubling down on the weaker aspects of Death Stranding.The story begins with Sam living a reclusive life near the Mexico border with Lou, the now-grown baby from the first game. A familiar face inevitably finds Sam and, once again, asks for help connecting an array of facilities to the network. This time, your destinations are fictional depictions of Mexico and Australia, and the journey involves collaborating with a growing crew of characters that cruise around with you in the DHV Magellan, a Metal Gear-shaped ship serving as the base of operations.Throughout the 33 hours it took me to reach the end credits, which included a few side activities along the way, the story focused on the effects of connecting the United States to the Chiral Network, while uncovering the whereabouts of returning characters. Sam's new tale is told sporadically, which feels like watching a very slow season of a TV show. Completing main missions grants enough parcels of story here and there to keep you engaged, but I spent a lot of time longing for a cutscene or conversation that might shed a little clarity or answers to mysteries introduced early on, as cutscenes sometimes fail to deliver relevant information or any character development. That being said, while some of the eventual revelations weren't as impactful as I had hoped, my interest in seeing the story through didn't wane.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Modeling the World in 280 Characters</title><link>https://tympanus.net/codrops/2025/06/23/modeling-the-world-in-280-characters/</link><author>OuterVale</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 10:02:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
  Hi, I’m Xor. As a graphics programmer, my job is essentially to make pixels prettier using math formulas. I work on
  video effects like lighting, reflections, post-processing, and more for games and animated backgrounds in software.

  For fun, I like to unwind by writing compact little shader programs that fit in a “tweet” (280 characters or less).
  You may have seen some of these posted on X/Twitter. The process of shrinking code while maintaining its functionality
  is called “code golfing.”
Here’s an animated galaxy I wrote in just 197 characters of GLSL code:
  This little piece of code runs in real time for every pixel on the screen and generates a unique output color using
  some fancy math and logic. I build these demos using a tool called
  Twigl.app
  , an online shader editor designed for sharing mini-shaders. It makes exporting videos super easy, and in its
  “geekiest” mode, it also takes care of the generic header code and shortens built-in variable names.
I even managed to fit a voxel DDA raytracer with edge detection into just 190 characters:
  Today, I’d like to explain why I make these, share my creation process, and show you how you can try it yourself if
  you’re interested. Let’s start with the “why.”

  Why do I write these? Well, there are several factors. Since I like lists, I’ll go ahead and present them in order of
  relevance:

    : Sometimes I get struck by a new idea and just want to play around with it. I like Twigl because it helps lower my
    expectations and lets me start doodling. There’s less room for overplanning, and it’s super easy to jump in.
  
    : Working within constraints forces me to think through problems differently. By optimizing for code size, I often
    find ways to simplify or approximate. It doesn’t always lead to more performant code (but often it does) and I’ve
    learned how to squeeze the most out of every byte. Having very little code makes it easier to experiment with
    formulas and variations without getting overwhelmed.
  
    : Writing tiny code is both challenging and stimulating. It keeps my brain sharp, and I’m constantly developing new
    skills. It’s basically become a game for me. I’ve accidentally learned a ton of math while trying to solve these
    technical problems.
  
    : I’ve connected with so many interesting people through this process—artists, designers, math folks, game devs,
    engineers, tech enthusiasts, and more. Sharing my work has led to some exciting encounters. (More on some notable
    people later!)
  
  So, in short, it’s fun, thought-provoking, and engaging, and it’s a great way to spark interest in graphics
  programming. Now, what even is a shader?

  In case you haven’t heard of shaders before, they are programs that run on the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) instead
  of the CPU (Central Processing Unit). CPUs excel at complicated or branching operations, which are computed
  sequentially, one at a time (I’m simplifying here). GPUs are designed to process billions or trillions of predictable
  operations per second in parallel. This sounds like a lot, but a 4K screen at 60 frames per second outputs nearly 500M
  pixels per second. Each pixel could have 100s or 1,000s of operations, not to mention anything else the GPU might be
  used for.

  There are several different types of shaders: vertex shaders, fragment shaders, compute shaders, and more, but these
  tweet shaders are specifically fragment shaders, also known as “pixel shaders,” because they run on every pixel. In
  essence, fragment shaders take the input fragment coordinates and output a color and opacity (or alpha). Fragment
  coordinates give you the position of the center of each pixel on screen, so (0.5, 0.5) is the bottom-left (or
  top-left). One pixel to the right is (1.5, 0.5), and so on to (width – 0.5, height – 0.5). The coordinates variable is
  called “FC” in Twigl. The output color, “o”, has 4 RGBA components: red, green, blue, and alpha, each ranging from 0.0
  to 1.0.

  is pure white,
  
  is opaque black, and
  
  is pure red in the RGBA color format. From here, you can already make simple color gradients:
o = vec4(0.0, FC.y/100.0, 0.0, 1.0)
  ;

  Remember, this is run on every pixel, so each pixel will have a unique Fragment Coordinate. That formula makes a
  simple gradient that starts black at the bottom of the screen (FC.y = 0.0), and the green output value reaches 1.0
  when FC.y reaches 100.0.

  So you have an output color “o”, the input fragment coordinates “FC”, and four “uniform” inputs which are shared among
  all pixels: “r” is the shader screen resolution in pixels, “t” is the time in seconds, and also the less commonly used
  mouse position “m” and the backbuffer texture “b”. And that’s the core of it! From there, it’s a lot of math and logic
  to control the output colors and generate cool images.

  I’m going to skip ahead a bit, but if you’re interested in learning more, try
  starting here
  !

  People often ask me whether I write my shaders in a compact form from the start or if I write them expanded and then
  reduce the code afterward. The answer is the former. I’ve practiced code golfing so much that I find it easier to
  prototype ideas in compact form, and I tend not to get lost in tiny shaders. Code golfing shaders requires finding the
  right balance between code size, render performance, artistic appeal, design, and mathematical function. It’s a
  delicate balance that definitely challenges both sides of my brain. I’ve learned a ton about math, art, and design
  through writing these!
To start one, you need an idea. When writing the “Milky” stars shader, I knew I wanted to create some kind of galaxy, so that was my initial spark. My shaders typically start with centering and scaling so that they look good at various resolutions and aspect ratios. For the stars, I looped through 100 point lights revolving around the center. I love glowing effects, and they are pretty easy to create. You just need to know the distance from the current pixel to the light source and use the inverse for the pixel brightness (close pixels are brighter, far pixels are darker). I played around with the positions of the particles using some trigonometry and gave the disk a slight skew. For the coloring, I love to use some sine waves with a phase shift for the RGB channels. Sine waves are also useful for picking pseudo-random numbers, so that’s how I select the colors for each star. Using the sine formula, you can get palettes like these: I ended up with a slight alteration of the one second from the left. It has a nice range of temperatures and brightness. I also added some variation to the star brightness, which made the image much more interesting to look at. Next, I applied some tonemapping with the hyperbolic tangent function for size. Tonemapping prevents the harsh overexposure and hue shifts that happen when a color channel hits its maximum brightness value (left is original, right is with tonemapping):
  Any good shader that has High Dynamic Range lighting should apply some tonemapping, and tweet shaders are no
  exception! Finally, I played with animation. It could have revolved or twisted, but in the end, I liked the
  contraction effect most. I also created a loop so that new stars faded in when the old stars reached the center. You
  can read about my design process in
  more detail here
  !

  As you can imagine, there are hundreds of little techniques that I have developed (and continue to discover) in the
  process of shrinking the code down, but I can give you the abridged version! My generalized code-golfing process can
  be listed like so:

    It may be challenging initially, but you can get used to single-letter variables and function names. You may
    sometimes forget what variables are for, but this is actually helpful for code golfing. It forces you to reread your
    code, and you’ll often find better ways to write it when doing so. Like anything else, your memory will improve with
    practice, and over time you will establish some standards (for me: p = position, c = color, O = frag output, I =
    input, etc.).
  
    This is pretty self-explanatory.
    
    ,
    
    . Don’t forget that with vector constructors, you can use any data type as an input, and it gets converted (“cast”)
    to the new type:
    vec4(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0) == vec4(1)
    . If you’re multiplying by
    
    , you could instead divide by
    
    .
  Minimize initializations:
    If you have two floats, “x” and “y”, try to initialize them together like so:
    
    Look for opportunities to share data types. If you have a color vec3 and a vec4, make them both vec4s. Avoid
    float/int conversions.
  
    If statements in GLSL take up a bit of space, especially if you need an
    
    . Try using a ternary instead. For example:
    if (x>y) O = vec4(1,0,0,1); else O = vec4(0,1,0,1);
    becomes
    O = x>y ? vec4(1,0,0,1) : vec4(0,1,0,1);
    . Much shorter, and there’s a lot you can do with it. You can even set multiple variables between
    
    and
    
    .
  
    and
    
    use the same number of characters, but
    
    has a spot for initializing (before the first semicolon) and a spot for the final step after each iteration (after
    the last semicolon). These are free slots that can be used for lines that would otherwise have to end with a
    semicolon. Also, avoid using
    
    , and use the condition spot instead! You can also remove the brackets if each line ends with a comma (so it doesn’t
    work with nested
    
    -loops).
  
  Beyond that, I use some function substitutions to reduce the code further. More on that
  over here
  !

  I’ve put together a
  ShaderToy demo
  with some additional variables, formatting, and comments for clarity. Every shader is different and requires using
  different techniques, approximations, and concepts, but that is precisely what makes it so fun for me! I’m still
  learning new stuff nearly every day!
Here are some questions I was asked on X.Do you have a favorite “trick” or “technique”? If so, what is it?How did you develop the intuition for related maths?
  It takes lots of time and patience. I had to push through many times when I thought a topic was over my head. If you
  take it in small pieces, take breaks, and sleep on it, you can learn a lot! I wrote about some of the
  conceptualization techniques
  that I’ve picked up over the years. That might save you some time!
Do you start writing the shader in code-golfing mode, or is it a process until you reach the most optimized code? Which is the best editor for normal shaders and for code-golfing shaders? 
  Yes, I write in code-golfing mode because I’ve developed an intuition for it, and it feels faster to prototype at this
  point. I still have to refine the code when I find a look that I like, though. I’m a big fan of Twigl.app, but
  ShaderToy is great too. ShaderToy is best for its community and wealth of knowledge. I try to use it when explaining
  my tweet shaders.
How did you start writing cool shaders, and what did you use to learn it?
  Well, I’ll explain more about my background later, but it started with an interest in game development. Shaders have
  tons of applications in video game graphics—that’s what sparked my curiosity to learn.
Do you have regrets related to sacrificing readability?
  Nope. I’m more concerned with size optimizations that lead to slower code, but I don’t mind the unreadable code. To
  me, that’s part of the magic of it.
What’s your background that got you to the point where you could effectively learn the material?Growing up, I was interested in video games, especially those with “fancy” 3D graphics. When I was around 10, my friend showed me a tool called GameMaker. I tinkered around with it and learned some of the basics of drag ‘n’ drop programming, variables, and conditionals. Over time, I started experimenting with 3D graphics in GM, even though it was (and still is) primarily a 2D game engine. It was enough to learn the basics of how 3D rendering works and the render pipeline. Later, GameMaker introduced this thing called “shaders,” which allowed developers to create more advanced effects. At the time, there weren’t many resources available, so it took a while for me to pick it up. I started posting my shaders on the GameMaker forums and got some helpful feedback from the community (shoutout to “xygthop3” for his helpful examples)! Game development was a great place to learn about shaders because you have performance constraints (you don’t want a game to stutter), and you learn a lot about the entire rendering process in that context. In 2014, I started posting my earliest shader tutorials, sharing techniques as I learned them. The early tutorials weren’t great, but I’m glad I wrote them. In 2015, I started exploring ShaderToy, and that’s where my skills really developed. There were so many great examples to learn from, and it was a good place to get feedback on my ideas. In 2021, I launched a new introductory tutorial series for GameMaker with GLSL 1.00. Now I post more generalized tutorials on all kinds of graphics topics, ranging from math to art to design to code and more. This is definitely my best series yet, and they continue to get better. If you are interested in video games and graphics, I highly recommend starting with GameMaker or Godot. They are relatively easy to learn while still powerful enough to teach you the ropes. If software or web dev is more your thing, you can’t go wrong with ShaderToy or compute.toys.Here are some of the great people who have helped me, directly or indirectly, along the way: – This guy’s free shader examples were probably the greatest help along the way. His examples were a pivotal point in my understanding of a variety of graphics techniques, so thanks, Michael! – Inigo is the author of ShaderToy and the king of raymarching. His Signed Distance Field functions are still foundational to this day. An absolute legend! – Fabrice is probably the best shader code golfer there is, and many shaders are inspired by his work. He has taught me so many techniques over the years. – Another major inspiration for me. Yonatan’s work convinced me to try code golfing for real on Twitter, and his brain is amazing.
  I’m sure there are many others whose names are eluding me at the moment, but I want to thank the entire shader
  community for their feedback and encouragement.
I’ll wrap this up with a few of my favorite tweet shaders so far:Thank you for reading! Have a great day!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How China is Beating India in Its Own Backyard</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVnKTVuCRYo</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/lVnKTVuCRYo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 08:00:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[India and China are locked in a high-stakes struggle for influence in the Indian Ocean.

This week the PSF released its 28-page Annual Impact Report this week, noting that 2024 was their first year with three CPython developers-in-residence — and "Between Lukasz, Petr, and Serhiy, over 750 pull requests were authored, and another 1,500 pull requests by other authors were reviewed and merged."


Lukasz Langa co-implemented the new colorful shell included in Python 3.13, along with Pablo Galindo Salgado, Emily Morehouse-Valcarcel, and Lysandros Nikolaou.... Code-wise, some of the most interesting contributions by Petr Viktorin were around the ctypes module that allows interaction between Python and C.... These are just a few of Serhiy Storchaka's many contributions in 2024: improving error messages for strings, bytes, and bytearrays; reworking support for var-arguments in the C argument handling generator called "Argument Clinic"; fixing memory leaks in regular expressions; raising the limits for Python integers on 64-bit platforms; adding support for arbitrary code page encodings on Windows; improving complex and fraction number support... 


Thanks to the investment of [the OpenSSF's security project] Alpha-Omega in 2024, our Security Developer-in-Residence, Seth Larson, continued his work improving the security posture of CPython and the ecosystem of Python packages. Python continues to be an open source security leader, evident by the Linux kernel becoming a CVE Numbering Authority using our guide as well as our publication of a new implementers guide for Trusted Publishers used by Ruby, Crates.io, and Nuget. Python was also recommended as a memory-safe programming language in early 2024 by the White House and CISA following our response to the Office of the National Cyber Directory Request for Information on open source security in 2023... Due to the increasing demand for SBOMs, Seth has taken the initiative to generate SBOM documents for the CPython runtime and all its dependencies, which are now available on python.org/downloads. Seth has also started work on standardizing SBOM documents for Python packages with PEP 770, aiming to solve the "Phantom Dependency" problem and accurately represent non-Python software included in Python packages. 


With the continued investment in 2024 by Amazon Web Services Open Source and Georgetown CSET for this critical role, our PyPI Safety & Security Engineer, Mike Fiedler, completed his first full calendar year at the PSF... In March 2024, Mike added a "Report project as malware" button on the website, creating more structure to inbound reports and decreasing remediation time. This new button has been used over 2,000 times! The large spike in June led to prohibiting Outlook email domains, and the spike in November was driven by a persistent attack. Mike developed the ability to place projects in quarantine pending further investigation. Thanks to a grant from Alpha-Omega, Mike will continue his work for a second year. We plan to do more work on minimizing time-on-PyPI for malware in 2025... 

In 2024, PyPI saw an 84% growth in download counts and 48% growth in bandwidth, serving 526,072,569,160 downloads for the 610,131 projects hosted there, requiring 1.11 Exabytes of data transfer, or 281.6 Gbps of bandwidth 24x7x365.

This week they also released a handy graph showing the movement of top 20 languages since 2012. Their current rankings for programming language popularity...



 1. JavaScript
2. Python
3. Java
4. PHP
5. C#
6. TypeScript
7. CSS
8. C++
9. Ruby
10. C 


The chart shows that over the years the rankings really haven't changed much (other than a surge for TypeScript and Python, plus a drop for Ruby). JavaScript has consistently been #1 (except in two early rankings, where it came in behind Java). And in 2020 Java finally slipped from #2 down to #3, falling behind... Python. Python had already overtaken PHP for the #3 spot in 2017, pushing PHP to a steady #4. C# has maintained the #5 spot since 2014 (though with close competition from both C++ and CSS). And since 2021 the next four spots have been held by Ruby, C, Swift, and R. 

The only change in the current top 20 since the last ranking "is Dart dropping from a tie with Rust at 19 into sole possession of 20," writes RedMonk co-founder Stephen O'Grady. "In the decade and a half that we have been ranking these languages, this is by far the least movement within the top 20 that we have seen. While this is to some degree attributable to a general stasis that has settled over the rankings in recent years, the extraordinary lack of movement is likely also in part a manifestation of Stack Overflow's decline in query volume..."

The arrival of AI has had a significant and accelerating impact on Stack Overflow, which comprises one half of the data used to both plot and rank languages twice a year... Stack Overflow's value from an observational standpoint is not what it once was, and that has a tangible impact, as we'll see.... 
As that long time developer site sees fewer questions, it becomes less impactful in terms of driving volatility on its half of the rankings axis, and potentially less suggestive of trends moving forward... [W]e're not yet at a point where Stack Overflow's role in our rankings has been deprecated, but the conversations at least are happening behind the scenes. 

"The veracity of the Stack Overflow data is increasingly questionable," writes RedMonk's research director:
When we use Stack Overflow for programming language rankings we measure how many questions are asked using specific programming language tags... While other pieces, like Matt Asay's AI didn't kill Stack Overflow are right to point out that the decline existed before the advent of AI coding assistants, it is clear that the usage dramatically decreased post 2023 when ChatGPT became widely available. The number of questions asked are now about 10% what they were at Stack Overflow's peak. 

"RedMonk is continuing to evaluate the quality of this analysis," the research director concludes, arguing "there is value in long-lived data, and seeing trends move over a decade is interesting and worthwhile. On the other hand, at this point half of the data feeding the programming language rankings is increasingly stale and of questionable value on a going-forward basis, and there is as of now no replacement public data set available. 

"We'll continue to watch and advise you all on what we see with Stack Overflow's data."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Civil War in the Holy Roman Empire</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/civil-war-in-the-holy-roman-empire</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/684befb57ffb4452ec8455bd/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=9a_lqjSu9gE6-euWYBThcMk2x0tr3j13-8FHaQ3QHf0" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jun 2025 23:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this episode, we hear about one of Europe’s most devastating conflicts - the Thirty Years’ War.

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux kernel, have surprisingly never met before. That all changed at a recent dinner hosted by Sysinternals creator Mark Russinovich... "No major kernel decisions were made," jokes Russinovich in a post on LinkedIn. 

More from the Linux news blog Linuxiac:


The man on the left is Mark Russinovich, a software engineer, author, and co-founder of Sysinternals, now CTO of Azure, Microsoft's cloud computing platform. He has become synonymous with deep Windows diagnostics and cloud-scale management. In the late 1990s, his suite of tools (Process Explorer, Autoruns, Procmon) revolutionized the way administrators and security professionals understood Windows internals. 

The man on the far right is another living legend: Dave Cutler. Let me put it this way — he's one of the key people behind OpenVMS and the brilliant lead architect who designed Windows NT's kernel and hardware-abstraction layer — technologies that remain at the heart of every current Windows release, from server farms to laptops. So, it's no surprise that people often call him the "father of Windows NT."

I wrote it in Typst, not LaTeX. In this post I will talk a bit about what went well and what didn't.Typst (https://typst.app/) is a modern take on a typesetting language that I think has a real shot at dethroning LaTeX. I would describe the language as a mix of markdown and dynamically typed Rust, which may sound weird but is a really nice fit. Day-to-day document writing being markdown-like is very comfortable (certainly much nicer than littering your writing with ). The scripting language is powerful, well thought out, and makes it very easy to jump between code and typesetting. For exampleThis is . The sum of [1, 2, 5, 8] is In the rest of this post, I will talk about some of the things I liked and disliked about Typst while writing the thesis.The thing that pushed me over the edge to try Typst for my thesis was a friend telling me his LaTeX thesis took 90 seconds to compile towards the end. I am far too easily distracted to tolerate 90 second compile times when I'm making small changes. The Typst compiler is , on small-medium sized documents it compiles fast enough to do live writing in the PDF preview. As my thesis grew beyond 150 pages, compile times dropped a bit. Clean builds take about 15 seconds, but it also does incremental compilation so for  changes, it is still nearly instant, for local layout changes it takes a second or two. Even for large global template changes,  10 seconds is a whole lot better than 90 seconds, and I am confident that being able to iterate on layout and style 9 times faster produced a nicer looking result in the end.The Typst language is amazingly well thought out. Markdown syntax is nicer than Tex syntax for general writing, but what really shines is the scripting language. My biggest complaint with LaTeX as a language is that  is consistent. Every package defines their own little utilities for even basic things like -statements. It feels like you don't learn LaTeX, you learn each package individually. Typst on the other hand is a well-designed dynamically typed language. Being Rust inspired and me being a Rust user meant that it barely feels like I had to learn the language at all, I can just assume that I'm writing Rust. That's not true as you get into more advanced things of course, but it feels like I  Typst in a way that I don't think is possible with LaTeX.This isn't just philosophical, being able to script Typst is extremely useful. For example, a central part of my thesis is that there are a lot of hardware description languages out there, and I wanted to come up with a way to categorize them. Over a few years, I have collected them all with some metadata in a toml file (https://gitlab.com/TheZoq2/list_of_hdls/). Since Typst can parse toml, I could simply use that data to generate a figure to put the languages into my taxonomy:Sure, it would be possible to do this in many other ways, but having it self-contained in the document is nice, and at this point Typst is one of my favourite scripting languages, so using it here is a no-brainer and something I did for pretty much all my data processing.A modern language of course also comes with modern tools, a compiler with dependency management, a working language server protocol integration for editors etc. All that makes it even nicer to work with.A few times I have tried to understand latex templates, and every time it has ended in frustration. I believe it took me longer to remove a header from our university presentation template than it did for me to write a new presentation template in Typst. Again, this comes down to the language being well-thought-out and consistent. This was also hugely advantageous when tweaking my thesis template the way I want it. Naturally, this is something of a double-edged sword, had I used LaTeX I would not have had to make a template in the first place, but at the same time, modifying anything in that template would have been much more difficult. This way I ended up with everything right where I wanted it without the frustration of figuring out how to get the results I wanted.My thesis has a lot of code in it, and I  reading code without good syntax highlighting. LaTeX's syntax highlighting systems leave a lot to be desired, but Typst's certainly does not. It does have built in support for textmate grammars, the same system used by sublime text for syntax highlighting, but for various reasons I decided not to use them. Instead, I just used Typst's  rules with regex. For example,will syntax highlight Spade conditionals. My syntax highlighting definitions¹ are… more more complicated but produce results that I am very happy with. At some point, I even ended up parsing a subset of Spade in Typst with a recursive descent parser because I really wanted to highlight named arguments. Was that a good way to spend my time? Debatable, but it certainly was not something I would have dreamt of doing in LaTeX.LaTeX error messages are awful. Typst is  much better with errors that  to the right place, gives accurate information about what is wrong, and doesn't fill the terminal with garbage. No more "Missing $ inserted!".Typst's bibliography management leaves some things to be desired when writing a whole thesis. The first roadblock I encountered was that you can only have one bibliography section and file per document. One per document is a deal breaker because I need one for the introduction, and one per included paper. My master  file makes heavy use of Bibtex variables which are included from other sources, this does not work in Typst. I ended up solving it with a Makefile that merges my files into one before going to Typst, but that's not ideal ²The multi-bibliography problem was worse, but luckily https://typst.app/universe/package/alexandria came along as I was working to save the day. It requires a little bit of work per bibliography so I would absolutely have preferred an automated system where I just do  and would insert all the citations I've used since last time, but Alexandria did the job.Then there is the  of the bibliography… At first glance, it looks fine but when you have an advisor that is very picky about bibliography styles, things start to go wrong. For example, paper titles should be written in sentence case with quotes around them, for example:[1] F. Skarman and O. Gustafsson, “Spade: An expression-based HDL with pipelines,” in Proc. Workshop Open-Source Des. Automat., Apr. 2023.But in the Bibtex file it is very common for the titles to appear in their original title case form (Spade: An Expression-Based HDL With Pipelines). By default, Typst does not seem to do this conversion, but it can be turned on with a custom  file. However, then it will not do it quite right. "Expression-Based" turns into "expression-Based" for example. In the end, I did the conversion to sentence case manually.The system is also kind of strange about what information it includes in references. For example, the  class in Bibtex has an  field. This does not get included, but changing it to  (which AFAIK is not a standard field in Bibtex) makes it work.I also found out that book titles should not be written with quotes, but with italics. I set a rule to match on  in my CSL field but it did not have an effect on , only on . In general, the bibliography management is death by a thousand papercuts, and a lot of them are caused by a very opaque translation from Bibtex fields to CSL…Wait, didn't I say that the error messages are good before? I did,but they are only good in simple cases. For example, with the Alexandria library, a bibliography that fails to compile only says "failed to parse bibliography" and does not give further errors. Errors in stateful show rules also do not give any breadcrumbs back to where the error was triggered which makes them hard to track down. In general, I would like to see a longer traceback for errors to avoid having feel like I'm writing latex again by binary searching recent changes.My thesis also has the dreaded Layout did not converge in 5 attempts warning which is pretty much impossible to debug currently. In my case, things turn out fine, but it is a bit sketchy. I believe this is being worked on.LaTeX is everywhere. My early papers were of course written in latex and I had to convert them to Typst. This was surprisingly easy with Pandoc which did 95% of the work with me just having to do a bit of final cleanup. Unfortunately, I also wrote a few new papers for the thesis that will be submitted later, and that's a more complicated situation since journals demand LaTeX code. My workflow so far has been to write the initial version of papers in Typst, submit the PDF as generated by Typst, then for the final version submit a converted version.For conversion, I don't believe pandoc works (or doesn't work the way I want it) so I had wrote my own tool ³. It lets me do 90% of the content and layout in Typst, use Typst for generating figures and code snippets, and then I can insert style tweaks with inline LaTeX. The Typst compiler being open source was of huge help here as I just hook into that. I will talk more about that tool in a future post once one of my papers compiled using it is made publicA big downside of this is that it generates latex with  for things like inline code. I am hoping publishers will not count those as figures and be weirded out by them…Everyone also knows LaTeX, so if I want to use Typst in collaboration, I force everyone I want to work with to learn it. My advisor was not super pleased with that 😇The Typst ecosystem is young. Being able to whip up a thesis template and doing all the tweaks to make it  is great. On the other hand, since I am probably the first person at my university to do it meant I  to whip up a template. For submitting to conferences and journals, there are Typst templates, but they are not flawless. The IEEE template only has conference variant, not a journal variant. The LLNCS template I found on git looked OK but had the wrong margins, so our paper ended up being slightly longer when converted to latex.With all this in mind, would I recommend using Typst for a PhD Thesis? If you are like me, absolutely probably. I like playing with programming languages, I'm easily frustrated by tools that bother me. I also much prefer a tool that I can tweak to get exactly the way I want over a tool that "just works" out of the box but where it is hard to tweak. In the end, I don't think I compromised on the quality of the document, the quick iteration probably made things look better than they would have otherwise. It certainly took some effort to work around a few issues, and some extra work setting up a template, but that was  work compared to having to suffer through LaTeX's annoyances.If you're not like me and want a system that works out of the box, Typst today probably isn't the right choice for a PhD thesis. But I would still recommend playing with Typst for smaller things but leave the big documents to LaTeX, for now.Updated June 23 2025: Changed absolutely to probably in the conclusion and added the 'advisors perspective section below'My advisor had a somewhat different perspective on this and I think it is worth posting that here. This is essentially taken verbatim from a LinkedIn comment where we discussed it:"The thing is that you HAD to tweak it to make things look the way they should. Not sure that is a benefit.Would I, as a supervisor, recommend someone to use Typst if they are in a field where all manuscripts are written in LaTeX? No. The fact that Frans is clever and a good programmer helped for sure. But think twice. Thrice if you are not a good programmer. And ask Frans for the scripts he developed to move things between Typst and LaTeX.It is simply not mature enough for most people to be used at this stage when you have to produce documents looking a particular way. Unless you are willing to spend much time on tweaking things etc. It may be mature for sure and someone will have to contribute to make it more mature for sure."Good" thing from a supervisor perspective is that I barely edited any text in the source at all, but had to let Frans edit the text (and format). Quite inefficient though.Despite the disagreement on the procedure, I cannot stress enough that the end result was great though! Both technically and layoutwise."He certainly has a point here, especially needing to be interested in working around issues and needing some programming experience to get things working perfectly. The problem of having to spend time adjusting things is in my opinion hard to quantify since it trades easy fun upfront work for frustration over other aspects of the language.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Klein Bottle Amazon Brand Hijacking (2021)</title><link>https://www.kleinbottle.com/Amazon_Brand_Hijacking.html</link><author>sebg</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jun 2025 19:18:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Understanding Why Scientists Are Terrified of the Sun&apos;s Next &quot;Carrington Event&quot;</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qIT9Oj14zA</link><author>Astrum</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/9qIT9Oj14zA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jun 2025 18:00:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-9b7aDP6ZN0coj9-xFnrtw">Astrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Check out Astrum’s Sun posters on Displate: https://astrumspace.info/Displates

Agriculture will also be impacted by Artificial Intelligence. Could AI present an opportunity for increased food security in the future?

From the climate crisis to depleted soils: farmers all over the world fear for their future. Our food security is at risk. The United Nations wants to end hunger worldwide by 2030. The advent of Artificial Intelligence could help.

In Cameroon, Adamou Nchange Kouotou has developed an AI-supported app that farmers can use to scan their crops. This enables them to recognize whether the plants are healthy, find out which pests are present and receive specific instructions for how to combat problems. This AI app already provides direct help to many small farmers who are cultivating depleted soils in the sub-Saharan region.

In southern Spain, the vegetable garden of Europe, Joaquín Soriano Fernandez relies on sensors to maintain the right temperature and humidity levels in his greenhouses. An algorithm ensures that drought-stricken farmers in the region can irrigate more precisely - and thus save a lot of water.
In Madrid, engineer Roemi Fernandez Saavedra is researching new harvesting technologies. Her two-armed harvesting robot can already recognize the shape of ripe tomatoes and eggplants. Her aim is to reduce costs and waste, while freeing people from undignified working conditions.
One of the biggest problems we face is food waste. In Germany alone, eleven million tons of food end up in the bin every year. 17 percent of this is produced in restaurants and canteens. That is why a company canteen in Lünen is now using an AI forecasting system that predicts which dishes are most likely to be in demand during the lunch break. 

Ethical issues are a major hurdle when using AI. Ameca, the world's most advanced humanoid robot, guides us through the film with his assessments: What are the potentials and limits of AI?

        In May 2022, someone posted to Hacker News Bartosz
          Ciechanowski's
          blog post
        explaining how mechanical watch movements work. Since then, his blog has
        been my absolute favorite corner of the Internet. His posts are not just
        well written and easy to follow, the accompanying interactive
        illustrations are magnificent.
        
        The first illustration in his blog post about mechanical watch movements
        allows you to "explode" a ticking mechanical movement and rotate it to
        inspect its every component from any angle. I owe my foray into the
        hobby of watchmaking to Bartosz, but that's not what this blog post is
        about. Instead, I want to scratch an itch I've had for years now: How
        cool would it be to hold an exploded view of a  mechanical
        watch in your hand?
        
        I figured that surely, someone has had this idea and built it before. On
        eBay you'll find cubes of resin embedding various random components from
        mechanical watches, but they are typically sold as "steampunk art" and
        bear little resemblance to the proper assembly of a mechanical watch
        movement. Sometimes, you'll find resin castings showing every component
        of a movement spread out in a plane like a buffet---very cool, but not
        what I'm looking for. Despite my best efforts, I haven't found anyone
        who makes what I'm after, and I have a sneaking suspicion as to why that
        is.
      
          Every component making up the movement of a beautiful 1960's Longines
          Flagship wristwatch I worked on recently, laid out "buffet style".
        
        Building an exploded view of a mechanical watch movement is undoubtedly
        very fiddly work and requires working knowledge about how a mechanical
        watch is assembled. People with that skillset are called watchmakers.
        , not "destroyer for the sake of art". I guess it falls to
        me, then, to give this project an honest shot.
      
        Here comes my favorite part: jumping head-first into a project requiring
        a set of skills I don't even know exist, let alone possess, following a
        process that develops as the project evolves. So how would one go
        about building a real-life exploded view of a mechanical watch movement?
        
        The first thing to consider is what type of mechanical watch movement to
        "explode". Although he doesn't explicitly say, I think Bartosz
        Ciechanowski's blog post is based on the ETA caliber
          2824-2 mechanical watch movement (or one of its many clones, such as
        the Chinese PT5000). This is a very robust and popular automatic
        (self-winding) mechanical wristwatch movement found in many watches.
        It's considered one of the all-time "workhorse" movements of the
        industry. I highly encourage the curious reader to check out this YouTube video
        of a very skilled and equally witty watchmaker servicing a Hamilton
        watch featuring this exact movement. The video will also reveal how many
        absolutely miniscule components make up the ETA-2824, making it less
        than ideal for my initial prototyping. A larger and simpler movement
        would be much better.
        
        Luckily, in the late 1800's to early 1900's, many people carried a
        pocketwatch about their person. However, as smaller wristwatches gained
        popularity among men, beginning around the first world war with trench
        watches, pocket watches lost their value as timepieces. Many were melted
        down to reclaim the gold used to case the movement. Today, you can find
        gorgeous, hand-engraved movements from the turn of the 20th century on
        eBay
        for next to nothing.
        
        Pocketwatches are the simplest mechanical watch movements out there:
        they typically don't have any date complications, aren't self-winding,
        and usually don't even have a central seconds hand---that's a
        relatively modern feature. There's a reason budding watchmakers start
        out practicing on pocketwatch movements.
        
        Now for the hard part: How do you suspend 50-100 tiny components to form
        an exploded view of the assembly?
      
        A beautiful early 1900's pocketwatch movement from eBay. $20 for a piece
        of horological art.
      
        The model I'm planning to build must stand up to being handled, which
        means it must be solid. In turn, that probably means that I need to cast
        my components in clear epoxy resin. My first idea was to build the
        exploded model up, layer by layer, letting the resin cure between each
        layer. To save time, I experimented with clear resin that cures when
        exposed to UV light. There are several reasons why this did not work:
      The resin I purchased ended up with a heavy yellow tint after
              curing.
            My puny UV flashlight took forever to cure a pour even 1 mm
              deep.The seams between layers are very visible.
        The first two problems can probably be solved by throwing money at the
        problem, but the last issue seems to be a problem with varying indices
        of refraction throughout my casting. The resin art community is
        well-aware of this problem, and the suggested solution is to pour the
        next layer of resin before the previous layer has fully cured. This
        supposedly helps the two layers fuse, and should make the transition
        between layers much less pronounced. Unfortunately, UV resin seems to
        cure from the outside in, meaning I needed to use "regular" two-part
        epoxy instead.
        
        To achieve the effect I want, I need around 20 layers for a regular
        pocket watch movement. If I were to cast each layer in a transparent
        container, adding components and epoxy as the previous layer was
        half-cured, I would be doing nothing else for a solid week. Instead, I
        figured my best bet was to cast all 20-or-so layers at once, and stack
        them together once the epoxy was semi-cured. So, my next project was to
        order some casting silicone and cast myself a mold suited to casting
        thin disks of clear epoxy. A baking tray studded with poker chips formed
        the ideal mold for casting the silicone.
        
        My resin disks solved problems 1 and 2 above, but problem 3 is still
        unsolved. In addition, this was a very messy and challenging way to
        cast resin: the half-cured disks are floppy, resin runs everywhere and
        bubbles get stuck between the layers. I bought a small vacuum chamber to
        combat the bubble issue, but escaping gas weaked havoc on the disks of
        resin. I learned enough about resin castings to finally realize that
        layered casting is not the way to go.
      
        1st attempt: embedding some nails in layers of UV resin.
      
        2nd attempt: Embedding more nails in disks of clear resin in a silicone
        mold...
      
        It took a while to accept that the only hope I had was to cast the
        entire model at once. This is difficult because I need to somehow
        suspend each tiny component in a way that is robust enough for me to
        pour resin all over it and then pull out any air bubbles.
        
        Scarred and burnt by resin's index of refraction, I went looking for
        very thin rods of plastic or acrylic that I could cut to length and glue
        my components to. Fishing line fits the bill. Specifically, monofilament
        nylon leader used in fly fishing. It comes in many thicknesses, has an
        index of refraction very similar to epoxy resin, and is cheap. The only
        major challenge with using fishing line is that it "remembers" its
        spooled shape, so every segment I cut off has a slight bend to it. I was
        able to remedy this somewhat by stringing it repeatedly across the grill
        pan in my oven and baking it at 150°C (300°F) for an hour or so. When done,
        the middle segments are reasonably straight and significantly stiffer
        than what I started with.
        
        The assembly process actually resembles "proper" watchmaking a lot. Of
        course, tweezer control and steady hands are important. But applying
        tiny drops of CA glue to components with a pinhead is a lot like
        applying oil to bearing surfaces and jewels. I just find it amusing to
        do it with glue instead of oil---CA glue being the complete
          opposite of a lubricant.
        
        Armed with a pair of helping hands and a set of self-closing tweezers, I
        found the process of building up the exploded model of a scrap watch
        movement to be very satisfying.
      
        0.7 mm monofilament fishing line attached to bridge screws.
      
        Monofilament fishing line maintains the distance betwen components. A
        jig holds everything still while the CA glue hardens.
      
        At this point I've tried a number of different epoxy resins claiming to
        cure crystal clear. As far as I can tell, they all turn out appreciably
        clear. Their main differences are viscosity, cure time and how much air
        they trap when mixing. Some resins claim to expel bubbles when curing.
        They manage this to some extent, but to get completely clear castings
        you either need a vacuum chamber to pull out all the air from your cast,
        or a pressure chamber to completely squash any pockets of air. I went
        for a vacuum pump because it's a fun thing to have around (boiling water
        at room temperature doesn't get old). Another benefit of the vacuum pump
        is that you don't need to leave your cast in the chamber for the entire
        cure time. My castings have a lot of voids that love to trap air, and
        the vacuum chamber does a good job of pulling out the trapped air.
        
        My casting method goes like this: Mix enough of part A and B of your
        resin to fill the mold plus 10–15 %. Mix thoroughly for 3 minutes. Pour
        the resin into another mixing container to ensure that no unmixed resin
        is stuck to the walls of your container. Use a fresh stirring stick, and
        mix for another 3 minutes. Pull the whole container under vacuum (I
        manage around -0.96 bar) and leave it there for 30 minutes. Depending on
        your resin, the froth may very well overflow your mixing container:
        cycle between pulling a vacuum and letting air back in a couple times to
        pop most of the bubbles.
        
        Now pour the resin into the mold and go through the vacuum process
        again. This time, most of the bubbles you're pulling out come from
        around the embedment, not from air trapped in the resin, which helps
        keep the frothing down.
      
        Some resins froth up to several times the liquid volume under vacuum!
        Make sure there's enough room to accomodate this.
      
        My first somewhat promising cast was in a borosilicate class cylinder. I
        won't dwell on the looks of this, because I mostly wanted to experiment
        and answer a few burning questions with this prototype:
       Not very! It's visible in the right light, but I don't
          think I'm able to do any better.
         Most resin datasheets say that CA glue can interfere with
          the resin's curing process, but I can't tell from this test.
         Definitely not. Light refracts on the curved cylinder
          surface making it difficult to understand the geometry inside,
          defeating the purpose of the model. Cast in a cube.
        
      A week or so later, the cylinder shattered. Resin shrinks as it cures. On
      to the next prototype!
      
        First prototype cast. Fishing line all but disappears in the resin.
      
        At this point I have settled on a somewhat structured process.

      
      Start with a clean, disassembled movement. For instructions on how to
      properly disassemble and clean a watch movement, I highly recomment Mark
        Lovick's Watch Repair Course.
      Assemble the train of wheels with their bridges and seize them by
      depositing small amounts of CA glue on the pinions. Just like with the
      watchmaker's oil, a sewing needle with a flat spot is perfect for
      picking up a small droplet of CA glue and depositing it where it's
      needed. Capillary action wicks it between the components. Less is more
      when it comes to CA glue: the bond between surfaces is stronger when no
      excess is used, and the cure time is around 30 seconds even without the
      use of an activator.
      
      I made a small jig for cutting pieces of fishing line accurately and
      squarely out of a janky hand press tool.
      
      Work starts on the train wheel side of the movement (often called the
      watchmaker's side) because that's where most of the complexity lies.
      While working here, the movement can rest in a movement holder. I attach
      long strands of fishing line to the end of each of the bridge screws.
      Self-closing tweezers hold the bridges in place above where they seat on
      the mainplate, and the screw/fishing line combo is threaded through the
      screw hole in the bridge into the corresponding holes in the mainplate.
      More glue binds the bridges to the fishing line.
      
      Subassemblies such as of the keyless works, motion works, balance
      assembly, etc. can be constructed separately and fastened as a unit.
      Small, flat components such as cover plates, intermediate wheels and cap
      jewels each get their own short studs of fishing line. I dip the studs
      in CA glue and place it near the center of mass of the component I'm
      working on: the fishing line's flat ends allows it to stand upright.
      Flip and assemble the dial side
      Before starting work on the dial side of the movement, it must be flipped
      over. I transfer the assembly into the jaws of some tweezers and apply
      closing force with a rubber band. The tweezers are clamped by "helping
      hands" glued to a piece of cardboard which allows me to spin my work
      around. Work continues similarly on the dial side. Finally, some thin
      transparent nylon sewing thread attaches the mainplate to a pegwood stick
      that allows me to suspend the whole assembly over a mold, ready for
      casting resin.
      Make the mold, prepare and pour resin
      Speaking of the mold: I bought some 2 mm thick 20x30 cm acrylic sheets.
      Foamcore or wood could work as well, but I don't want the vacuum pump to
      pull air from the mold into the casting. I cut them into 7x10 cm
      rectangles and lined them with "epoxy mold tape" (fancy packing tape
      that epoxy resin does not bond to). Then I used some Tec7 construction
      adhesive to form a cube.
      
      Prototype #2 shows a lot of promise! It's far from perfect, though. Here
      are some of the things I'll improve for prototype #3 in no particular
      order:
      I struggled with attaching subassemblies to the mainplate because
              I need to precisely control the distance between the subassembly and
              the target surface: too snug and the assembly ends up crooked, too
              far away and the glue doesn't adhere properly. A proper lab jack
              (tiny scissor lift) might solve this, so one is on the way.
            The resin shrunk a lot while curing, most likely because it
              overheated. I'll focus on proper airflow for my next cast.
            
              People noted that it's difficult to see between the components, so
              I'll "explode" the next model even more.
            
              The hands are set to an invalid time. 10:10 is the way to go.
            
        The third iteration incorporated the scissor lift lab jack into the
        process which, together with helping hands, allowed for much greater
        precision in bringing components together true and square. I'm also
        committing another watchmaking sin by placing a small magnet in the jaws
        of my self-closing tweezers to gently hold tiny screws. This allows me
        to lower a screw into its target drop of CA glue and simply lift the
        tweezers once the glue has set. This is a much more reliable method than
        trying to hold onto a sub-millimeter screw with self-closing tweezers
        whose gripping force I have little control over. Magnets are sinful in
        this case because magnetism can cause all sorts of timing issues in
        mechanical watch movements, but that's obviously not an issue in my
        case.
        
        I also started using a CA accelerator to speed up the assembly, because
        waiting for glue to cure is painful. Spraying the accelerator onto my
        work would create a huge mess, so instead I spray some into a lidded
        container and use tweezers to pick up droplets of the stuff to deposit
        accurately onto the glue joints. This stuff is too volatile and runny to
        be picked up by a needle. For me, the most effective use of the CA
        accelerant is to first place a drop of CA glue on one of the two mating
        surfaces, then dip the other surface in accelerant and quickly bringing
        them into contact. I believe this works well because the joint cures
        along the interface instead of curing from the outside-in as is the case
        when spraying accelerant after the joint has glue in it.
        
        You may see that the balance wheel is hanging from the hairspring in
        this casting. The balance wheel marks the end of the train of wheels and
        releases tiny amounts of energy from the mainspring 18,000 times per
        hour. The balance assembly is the heart of the movement and is also the
        most delicate component, and I want to highlight that by stretching the
        hairspring to show its form. These components are not glued in place,
        and the balance wheel hangs freely from its spring, meaning I have to
        cast the whole assembly upside-down to achieve this effect.
      
        At this point I figured I was ready to tackle the final boss of this
        project: the ETA 2824 wristwatch movement that we've all seen in Bartosz Ciechanowski's
        blog post. Well, I'll tackle the Chinese PT5000 clone movement
        instead, because I can't justify spending €300 on a genuine movement
        only to ensure it will never run again.
      
          Comparing my PT5000 to Bartosz's render.
        
        This movement arrived from China in good working order---I was actually
        suprised at its performance out of the box. It ran with good amplitude
        and little positional variance between horizontal and vertical
        positions. I became less and less impressed as I disassembled the
        movement prior to cleaning, though, because it was absolutely drenched
        in oil. Many of the bridges had sharp burrs that broke off during
        cleaning. Nothing was broken though. All in all, these movements really
        need a proper service before putting them to service. That's not an
        issue here though.
        
        I was worried that the much smaller components would be challenging to
        work with, but I found the process to be essentially the same as for
        larger pocket watch movements. My 0.7 mm nylon fishing wire still fits
        through most of the screw holes and the lab jack makes alignment a
        breeze.
        
        Some components needed special care, in particular the balance shock
        springs that protect the delicate pivots of the balance staff from
        shocks. These aren't normally found on older pocket watch movements
        which is why a broken balance staff is one of the most common failure
        modes of pocketwatches. Shock springs are fragile and are, in my
        opinion, among the most difficult components to handle when servicing a
        watch. Of course, I want to also explode the balance assembly, so I
        needed a way to suspend the shock springs above the capstone jewel. By
        laying the spring down flat on silicone and placing a drop of CA glue on
        it, the surface tension of the glue fills in the inner disk. Once cured,
        the spring with its hard and transparent interior can be lifted off the
        silicone. This is how the luminous material (lume) is applied to the
        hands of a watch---another watchmaker's trick.
        
        The assembly process was luckily uneventful, and I finished the build
        off with a black dial and a random set of hands from eBay.
        Unfortunately, the casting process went completely south. Only after I
        had created a mold, mixed, degassed, and poured resin, did I realize
        that my mold was just barely too tall to fit comfortably in the vacuum
        chamber. With some hasty modifications to the scaffolding that supported
        the exploded model, I was able to pull a reasonable vacuum on it, but it
        left the exploded model crooked. To add insult to injury, the resin
        seems to have dissolved the paint on the date indicator ring, which left
        milky streaks throughout the casting.
        
        All in all, I spent roughly 18 hours stripping, cleaning and assembling
        the exploded view of the PT5000. With improved technique I might get
        this down below 15 hours, but it's  tedious work, and rushing
        means I'll knock something off and have to redo work. Good to know,
        because I will be doing this again until I get it right.
        The PT5000 disassembles nicely into a steampunk whale.Installing the barrel bridge assembly.Final casting. The paint on the date ring, dial and hands dissolved. Also, the model is crooked.
        Prototype #4 has a couple flaws which I'd like to fix before calling
        this project done. The process of assembling the model is more or less
        nailed down: I just need to find a way to seal any painted surface
        before casting, as well as try to remember that my vacuum chamber has
        limited volume. I bought another PT5000, this time in a complete watch
        with case and a metal band, and started experimenting with sealing the
        painted surfaces. Here's what didn't work:
      CA glue dissolves paint just as readily as epoxy resin. It might
          work on simple paint-jobs like the chapter indices and the hands, but
          the date ring has crisp lines (the numbers) which I need to
          preserve.UV curable CA glue didn't cure on top of the paint. No idea why.Same with UV curable epoxy resin.
      Clear spray lacquer from the hardware store worked well and didn't
      dissolve the paint. It did turn yellow as you'll see in the final casting,
      but I'm okay with that. I also built a better jig to cut the fishing line
      into equal lengths with square ends. It's a bit janky but worked very
      well.
      
      There's not much more to say. I'll stop blabbering and make way for an
      image series.
      Janky but effective cutting jig for fishing line.Painting the dial, hands and calendar ring...
          The watchmaker's side of the movement is assembled and fastened to the case.
        
          Our watch is held by a stiff cardboard tube (okay, a toilet roll core)
          to keep the finished half suspended mid-air while work continues on
          the dial-side.
        
          Aligning the date ring...
        
          Done! I wish I could keep it in this form, but it's too
          fragile.

ABSTRACT
Architects in the enterprise are often regarded as ivory tower residents who bestow their utopian plans upon project teams in the form of colorful diagrams that bear little to no resemblance to reality. The most suspicious in this group are often the “Enterprise Architects” who are perceived as being furthest from actual technical problems.

However, large-scale IT operation and transformation require transparency across hundreds or thousands of applications running on all sorts of middleware in data centers around the globe. The very enterprise architects are likely the only ones who stand a chance to bring transparency into such an environment and who can direct IT investments in the hundreds of millions of Euros towards modernization and run-cost reduction. This sounds a lot more exciting and valuable than drawing pictures!

This session takes a serious but light-hearted look at the role of enterprise architects in modern IT organizations. Gregor is a recognized thought leader on asynchronous messaging and service-oriented architectures. He is widely known as co-author of the seminal book “Enterprise Integration Patterns” and as frequent speaker at conferences around the world. He is an active member of the IEEE Software editorial advisory board. He has documented his experience as an architect driving IT transformation in the eBook "37 Things One Architect Knows". [...]

This invention unfortunately only supports the  operating systems of Windows and macOS, which necessitated the development of a Linux driver.Over the past few posts I’ve set up a Windows VM with USB passthrough, and attempted to reverse-engineer the official drivers,  As I was doing that, I also thought I’d message the vendor and ask them if they could share any specifications or docs regarding their protocol. To my surprise, Nanoleaf tech support responded to me within 4 hours, with a full description of the protocol that’s used both by the Desk Dock as well as their RGB strips. The docs mostly confirmed what I had already discovered independently, but there were a couple of other minor features as well (like power and brightness management) that I did not know about, which was helpful.Today, we’re going to take a crack at writing a driver based on the (reverse-engineered) protocol, while also keeping the official documentation at hand. One small problem, though: I’ve never written a Linux device driver before, nor interacted with any USB device as anything else but a user.Most Linux distros ship with , a simple utility that will enumerate all USB devices connected to the system. Since I had no clue where to start from, I figured I might as well run this to see if the device appears in the listing.Well, good news, it’s definitely there. But, how can the kernel know that what I have plugged in is the “Nanoleaf Pegboard Desk Dock”? The kernel (presumably) has no knowledge of this device’s existence, yet the second I plug it in to my computer it receives power, turns on and gets identified by the kernel.As it turns out, we actually already have a driver! It’s just a very stupid one. If we run  in verbose mode and request the information just for this specific device, we will get a lot more details about it:This is a  of information, so we need to take a quick USB class.The USB spec is long, complicated and mainly aimed at low-level implementations (think kernel developers, device vendors, and so on). You can, of course, still read it if you enjoy being bored. But, thankfully, a kind soul collected the good parts into USB in a NutShell.To summarize the summary, a USB device can have multiple , which usually explain the power requirements for the device. Most devices will have just one.Each of those configurations can have multiple . So for example, a camera might serve as a file storage device as well as a webcam.Finally, each interface can have multiple , whcih describe how the data is transferred. Perhaps the camera has an “isochronous” (continuous) transfer for a webcam feed, and a “bulk” transfer for moving image files over.Going back to our device, we can see that it exposes one interface, which is a . HIDs are a class of USB devices that covers things like keyboards, mice or gamepads, and each of those categories is a separate . The kernel contains a generic driver for USB HIDs - here it is in all of its C glory.This is why the kernel developers do not need to write specific drivers for each individual keyboard and mouse on the market. Vendors will label their device with one of the well-known HID sub-classes, then use a common protocol to implement the functionality.Unfortunately there’s no HID specification for an RGB LED… thing (well, there’s an “LED” specification, but it’s mainly for things like status LEDs, not color LEDs) so our device is just a plain old generic HID with an interface sub-class of . This means that the kernel recognizes it and powers it correctly, but it doesn’t really know what to do with it, so it just lets it sit there.There are two options that we have at this point:We could write a kernel driver that follows the kernel standard and exposes each individual LED as 3 devices (one per color) under . Interacting with the kernel devs sounds scary (yes I realize I’m a grown-ass adult man), but even if it wasn’t, I question the utility of trying to merge drivers for a very niche product into the kernel. Also,  feels like it’s intended for status LEDs and not  anyway.We could write a userspace driver through libusb, thus defining our own way of controlling LEDs and reducing the quality bar from “Linus Torvalds might send you a strongly worded letter if you fuck up” to “fuck it, we ball”.Given that I have no idea what I am doing, I’m gonna go for option 2, but if one of you brave souls goes for option 1, please let me know and I will print out a photo of you and frame it on my wall.To do anything fun on Linux, you need to be . This is also the case when talking to USB devices. You could always run your drivers as , thus sidestepping the problem. But we all know that’s bad form. And if I am to distribute this driver, most people would expect to run it without privilege escalation.Linux generally relies on  to manage handlers for hardware events. I will spare you the long story this time and just give you the magic incantation: to make your device accessible to users, you need to create a file at  /etc/udev/rules.d/70-pegboard.rules with the following contents:where  and  are the vendor and product IDs you got from , and  is the spell that grants the currently active user permissions to manage the device. Then, unplug your device and plug it back in.Okay, enough yapping. Let’s start with a basic Rust binary and immediately add the  crate, which will serve as a binding to .To get going, we can try to get a handle on the device and get basic information about it, just like . This is explained pretty well in the crate readme, so I will not dwell on it too much. We’ll need a , which gives us a handy  method that we can use to get a handle to a device.Now that we have access to the device, we want to write a simple payload to it. For that, we first need to claim an interface. Recall that interfaces are essentially capabilities of the device, and through  we learned that we only have one interface with the ID () of . Thankfully, there’s an obvious  method on a .So, what you just experienced is the joy of  error messages. This message, at 4 characters, is in fact pretty generous - you might be greeted with a message that only says , and good luck debugging that. In general,  means that something is already holding the device open, so you cannot do anything with it. However, you won’t actually be told what is holding it open.The secret is that the device is, of course, being held open by the kernel. This is the generic driver I talked about earlier. And the secret solution is to release the kernel driver, if it is currently active on the device.This requires you to have write access to the device, so if you did not do the  song and dance from earlier in this article, prepare to prefix all future invocations of your driver with .Note that the kernel driver won’t be reattached automatically, so you might want to call device.attach_kernel_driver(INTERFACE) if, for some reason, you need it back.Sending data to the deviceSurely,  we are ready to write out some bytes to a device?Well, almost! If we try to naively start typing out something like , the IDE will helpfully suggest three options: ,  and . This corresponds to three out of four possible types of endpoints that the USB standard supports. Once again, USB in a NutShell comes in clutch with an explanation of what each of the endpoint types mean. Thankfully, we can mostly skip over the implementation details, as we can once again refer to the  readout from earlier:In USB parlance,  is always something that the device sends to the host, and  is always something that the host sends to the device. Basically, since this interface has two endpoints, and only one of them is an  endpoint, it’s safe to assume we’re looking to  on endpoint . The peculiarities of Interrupt endpoints will absolutely come back to bite us in a couple of minutes, but for now we can keep them out of sight and out of mind.For testing purposes, I want to make the pegboard show a solid red color. According to my earlier investigation, this means that I need to send , followed by 64 repeats of , to an endpoint at . In addition,  only exposes the blocking API of , so we will also need to define a timeout after which  will give up and error out.And… just like that, the pegboard now shows a solid red color! We didn’t need to worry about manually splitting packets or any of the underlying implementation, just open up a pipe and write to it! It’s that easy.Let’s run it again to make sure it was not a fluke!So, about those interrupts…Yeah, so if you happen to be following along, and you ran the same binary twice, you’ll notice that the firmware of the pegboard crashes unceremoniously, and shortly after reverts to its default animation. And if I go back to the original packet capture - or the official docs - it’s pretty obvious why: the device sends us back a response, but we never read it.It turns out that “interrupts” are named as such for a reason, and we should probably handle them as they come in. However, the USB spec defines that the  must poll for interrupts. A device cannot interrupt the host by itself.For our simple “driver”, this means we want to poll the device right after we write to it. Thankfully,  gives us a  method, and we have already sneakily defined the  constant. Let’s do just that:Running this, we see that the contents of  are , which corresponds to  I got from the research. And since we clear the interrupt buffer every time now, we can run this binary many times to define a single solid color on the device. Neat!Of course, this is… not really what you want. The device may issue more interrupts. For example, there’s a single button on the desk dock, which can be clicked, double-clicked or long-clicked, and each of those will issue a different interrupt. So what we  want is a background task of sort that will actively poll the device for interrupts and process them as they come in.This is where you can get wild with async Rust, , channels, and other fun stuff. That would certainly be the  to do it in an actual, serious driver. But to avoid getting into complexities of async Rust, let’s keep it vanilla and use .We’ll also adjust the timeout for reading interrupts to be 1 millisecond, as requested by the device (the  value in the  readout). This doesn’t mean we will get an interrupt every millisecond, just that the device  send one at that rate. If the device sends nothing (i.e., we get  ), we will just continue with the loop.Put together, that might look something like this:This… works! Of course, we send no more color frames to the device, so we won’t get any more interrupts, but we now have two threads, one which we can use to change the colors shown, and another which we can use to read the interrupts.There are some quirks with this device: it seems to require a steady stream of color frames, otherwise it reverts to “offline mode” as it does not receive any new frames from the host, and the first frame’s brightness is significantly lower than the brightness of future frames. Not to mention that, despite what the official protocol documentation would have you believe, the colors seem to be in GRB instead of RGB format, and if you make the device , it will just hard-reset after a couple of seconds. That is, I suppose, a part of the joy of coding.But this small proof of concept shows that writing simple device drivers is not all that hard, and that 50 lines of code can bring you quite far. Over the next few weeks I hope to polish up my proof of concept, make a small GUI for it, pack it up and share it with the two other Linux users who own this dumb thing. And I’m happy to have learned the basics of reverse-engineering a simple USB device driver, and using that as a foundation for writing my own. Even if I could have just asked for the spec earlier and not fussed with it.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: I&apos;m a doctor and built a responsive breathing app for anxiety and sleep</title><link>https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lungy-breathing-exercises/id1545223887</link><author>lukko</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jun 2025 09:40:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[** App of the Day, March 2025 ** – Apple** Featured in Mashable, TechCrunch, ItsNiceThat and WePresent **Feel happier & healthier with Lungy — the breathing app that recognizes and responds to your breath, helping you feel calmer and more relaxed.

"Students light up when they create something meaningful," the article begins. "Self-expression fuels learning, and creativity lies at the heart of the human experience." 

But they also argue that "As AI rapidly reshapes software development, computer science education must move beyond syntax drills and algorithmic repetition." Students "must also learn to think systemically..."
As AI automates many of the mechanical aspects of programming, the value of CS education is shifting, from writing perfect code to shaping systems, telling stories through logic and designing ethical, human-centered solutions... [I]t's critical to offer computer science experiences that foster invention, expression and design. This isn't just an education issue — it's a workforce one. Creativity now ranks among the top skills employers seek, alongside analytical thinking and AI literacy. As automation reshapes the job market, McKinsey estimates up to 375 million workers may need to change occupations by 2030. The takeaway? We need more adaptable, creative thinkers. 
Creative coding, where programming becomes a medium for self-expression and innovation, offers a promising solution to this disconnect. By positioning code as a creative tool, educators can tap into students' intrinsic motivation while simultaneously building computational thinking skills. This approach helps students see themselves as creators, not just consumers, of technology. It aligns with digital literacy frameworks that emphasize critical evaluation, meaningful contribution and not just technical skills. 
One example of creative coding comes from a curriculum that introduces computer science through game design and storytelling in Minecraft... Developed by Urban Arts in collaboration with Minecraft Education, the program offers middle school teachers professional development, ongoing coaching and a 72-session curriculum built around game-based instruction. Designed for grades 6-8, the project-based program is beginner-friendly; no prior programming experience is required for teachers or students. It blends storytelling, collaborative design and foundational programming skills with a focus on creativity and equity.... Students use Minecraft to build interactive narratives and simulations, developing computational thinking and creative design... Early results are promising: 93 percent of surveyed teachers found the Creative Coders program engaging and effective, noting gains in problem-solving, storytelling and coding, as well as growth in critical thinking, creativity and resilience. 

As AI tools like GitHub Copilot become standard in development workflows, the definition of programming proficiency is evolving. Skills like prompt engineering, systems thinking and ethical oversight are rising in importance, precisely what creative coding develops... As AI continues to automate routine tasks, students must be able to guide systems, understand logic and collaborate with intelligent tools. Creative coding introduces these capabilities in ways that are accessible, culturally relevant and engaging for today's learners. 

Some background from long-time Slashdot reader theodp:



The Urban Arts and Microsoft Creative Coders program touted by EdSurge in its advertorial was funded by a $4 million Education Innovation and Research grant that was awarded to Urban Arts in 2023 by the U.S. Education Department "to create an engaging, game-based, middle school CS course using Minecraft tools" for 3,450 middle schoolers (6th-8th grades)" in New York and California (Urban Arts credited Minecraft for helping craft the winning proposal)... New York City is a Minecraft Education believer — the Mayor's Office of Media and Entertainment recently kicked off summer with the inaugural NYC Video Game Festival, which included the annual citywide Minecraft Education Battle of the Boroughs Esports Competition in partnership with NYC Public Schools.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>TPU Deep Dive</title><link>https://henryhmko.github.io/posts/tpu/tpu.html</link><author>transpute</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jun 2025 02:51:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump Addresses Nation After U.S. Bombs Nuclear Sites in Iran | WSJ</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH9ZFDa9wk4</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/cH9ZFDa9wk4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jun 2025 02:08:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[President Trump said the U.S. has attacked three of Iran’s nuclear sites: Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan.

Its closure could lead to significant delays in the supply of oil needed by global markets, with a rise in oil prices.Around a fifth of the planet's crude oil goes through the strait, which is only 40km wide at its narrowest point.Several countries could be impacted, including the Gulf countries such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Kuwait, but the impact is not limited to them.China, India, Japan, and South Korea are among the top importers of crude oil that passes along it. Beijing is highly unlikely to welcome any rise in oil prices or disruptions to shipping routes.And of course, by closing one of its major export routes, Iran itself would lose out. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio today said it would be “economic suicide”.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Greatest Engineering Breakthroughs Of The Ancient World</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIvx8Y1UQqk</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/UIvx8Y1UQqk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 21:00:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Discover the astonishing engineering prowess of ancient civilizations, from the icnoic Roman Colosseum to the unbelievable Hanging Temple of Hengshan.

The consequences for the civilian population have been devastating. Hundreds of thousands have sought refuge in the remote Nuba Mountains, where there has been less fighting.

For decades, those living in the Nuba Mountains in southern Sudan were oppressed by the authoritarian regime based in the capital, Khartoum. The remote region still lacks paved roads and mobile phone coverage. Most concerning is the severe shortage of medical facilities.

In one of the region's few hospitals, a surgeon and his team are working tirelessly to maintain medical care. Since the outbreak of the civil war in April 2023, conditions have deteriorated significantly. The frontlines are nearby, but so far the region has largely been spared from direct fighting. However, like half of Sudan's population, the people here also face the threat of famine.

The civil war erupted between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), both vying for control of Africa's third-largest country. This power struggle has had devastating effects on the population. Approximately 50 million people live in the country. Around 25 million are currently acutely food insecure, and more than 12 million individuals have been displaced.

The documentary follows Joseph Yacoub, the director of a hospital, as he navigates his everyday life. He is the only surgeon in the area, and the hospital receives hundreds of patients a day - including women in the late stages of pregnancy, wounded fighters, and mothers with malnourished children. Not all of them can be helped.

Joseph had to learn his surgery skills on the job as there are no universities in the Nuba Mountains He is now passing on his knowledge to Nidal Difan, who aspires to become the first female surgeon in the Nuba Mountains, and Aziz Burma, who is a former soldier. Joseph hopes that one day, these two will carry on with his work. The film sheds light on a seemingly endless war that has left deep scars on the population. The people portrayed are all striving for a future where the war has become a distant memory.

But a recent Anthropic blog post notes this feature "involves an agent that plans a research process based on user queries, and then uses tools to create parallel agents that search for information simultaneously," which brings challenges "in agent coordination, evaluation, and reliability.... The model must operate autonomously for many turns, making decisions about which directions to pursue based on intermediate findings."
Multi-agent systems work mainly because they help spend enough tokens to solve the problem.... This finding validates our architecture that distributes work across agents with separate context windows to add more capacity for parallel reasoning. The latest Claude models act as large efficiency multipliers on token use, as upgrading to Claude Sonnet 4 is a larger performance gain than doubling the token budget on Claude Sonnet 3.7. Multi-agent architectures effectively scale token usage for tasks that exceed the limits of single agents. 

There is a downside: in practice, these architectures burn through tokens fast. In our data, agents typically use about 4Ã-- more tokens than chat interactions, and multi-agent systems use about 15Ã-- more tokens than chats. For economic viability, multi-agent systems require tasks where the value of the task is high enough to pay for the increased performance. Further, some domains that require all agents to share the same context or involve many dependencies between agents are not a good fit for multi-agent systems today. 

For instance, most coding tasks involve fewer truly parallelizable tasks than research, and LLM agents are not yet great at coordinating and delegating to other agents in real time. We've found that multi-agent systems excel at valuable tasks that involve heavy parallelization, information that exceeds single context windows, and interfacing with numerous complex tools.

What remarkable discoveries are being made in cosmology! Cosmologists now develop credible theories about the beginning and end of our universe and theory-based speculations about vast numbers of multiple universes. But does the cosmos have a reason? Could revolutionary ideas support some kind of ‘universal reason’? The bar is set high, and it is OK to say no.

Ernan McMullin was an Irish philosopher who last served as the O’Hara Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at the University of Notre Dame. He was an internationally respected philosopher of science who has written and lectured extensively on subjects ranging from the relationship between cosmology and theology, to the role of values in understanding science, to the impact of Darwinism on Western religious thought. He is the only person to ever hold the presidency of four of the major US philosophical associations. He was an expert on the life of Galileo.

Neil deGrasse Tyson and cohosts Chuck Nice and Gary O’Reilly hang out with astrophysicist Charles Liu to answer questions about the nature of gravity, dark matter, and why we don’t actually know how the solar corona gets hot. 

We explore some of the universe’s deepest mysteries: could dark matter be matter leaking from other dimensions? What happens before black holes collide? And are gravitational waves just the beginning of our understanding of cosmic communication? We break down the known forces in the universe, their corresponding particles, and why gravity is different. Is gravity a force, a curvature, or just semantics? And if gravity is a force, where’s the graviton?

We spiral into extra dimensions, frame dragging, and why gravity could be the only force that doesn’t respect spacetime boundaries. If gravity could leak from parallel dimensions, what else can? Plus, can we explore Europa’s ocean without contaminating it? Are people rethinking Einstein’s theory in light of new supernova data? We discuss the ethics of ice fishing for alien whales and the enduring lessons of Copernicus.

Finally, what can the Parker Solar Probe teach us about our Sun and other stars beyond? Does the solar corona actually feel that hot? Learn about the unsolved mysteries of the photosphere and why an iceberg has more heat than your morning cup of coffee. Could our universe be part of a continuous time loop?

Without users’ knowledge or consent, this bloatware collects sensitive personal data, cannot be removed without compromising device security, and offers no clear information about its privacy practices.AppCloud, developed by the controversial Israeli-founded company ironSource (now owned by the American company Unity), is embedded into devices sold in countries where such affiliations carry legal implications. Despite the serious privacy and security risks, Samsung has offered no transparency on how AppCloud functions, what data it collects, or why users cannot opt out.This open letter, addressed to Samsung, calls for immediate transparency, accountability, and dialogue. Users deserve to know what is installed on their devices and how their data is being used, especially amid Israel’s espionage campaigns in the region. We are writing to urgently request that Samsung be transparent regarding the pre-installation of AppCloud on its A and M series smartphones, particularly in West Asia and North Africa (WANA). We ask that Samsung provide information about AppCloud’s privacy practices, opt-out and removal options, and that Samsung reconsider future pre-installations in light of privacy rights. We also request a meeting with Samsung teams to discuss these concerns further. According to our analysis, this intrusive software is , deeply integrated into the devices’ operating system, making it nearly impossible for regular users to uninstall it without root access, which voids warranties and poses security risks. Even disabling the bloatware is not effective as it can reappear after system updates. The privacy policy is there is no accessible and transparent privacy policy for this bloatware and users are in the dark about what data is collected and how it is used. There is also no straightforward opt-out mechanism. The bloatware collects sensitive user data, including biometric information, IP addresses, device fingerprints. The installation of AppCloud is done from the user, which violates GDPR provisions in the EU and relevant data protection laws in the WANA region states. AppCloud is developed by ironSource, an Israel-founded company (now acquired by American company Unity), raising additional legal and ethical concerns in countries where Israeli companies are barred from operating, such as Lebanon. ironSource is notorious for its questionable practices regarding user consent and data privacy. Samsung’s terms of service mention third party applications but do not specifically address AppCloud or ironSource, despite the significant data access and control granted to this bloatware app. The forced installation of AppCloud undermines the privacy and security rights of users in the MENA region and beyond. The lack of transparency and control over personal data is particularly alarming given Samsung’s significant market share in the region.In light of these concerns, we respectfully request that Samsung:Disclose the full privacy policy and data handling practices of AppCloud, making this information easily accessible to all users.Offer a straightforward and effective method for users to opt out of AppCloud and remove it from their devices without compromising device functionality or warranty.Provide a clear explanation for the decision to pre-install AppCloud on all A and M series devices in the WANA region.Reconsider the continued pre-installation of AppCloud on future devices, in line with the right to privacy as established by Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.We also request a meeting with the relevant Samsung teams to discuss these issues in detail and to better understand the company’s approach to user privacy and data protection in the WANA region.We look forward to your prompt response and to working together to ensure the privacy and security of all Samsung users.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A Capitol Fourth 2025 | PBS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZUfyEww87o</link><author>PBS</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/HZUfyEww87o?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 22:20:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgyeJxD05YnoDquRMNBfBqw">PBS</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Official Website: https://to.pbs.org/4e60eQM | #July4thPBS

In 1949, Life magazine asked: “Is Jackson Pollock, the greatest American Painter. He is a figure that is polarising among art aficionados. Some see him as a fraud, others as a genius.

In Part Two of my film I look at how fame affected Jackson Pollock, and how alcohol destroyed his relationships. I look at the science behind why we are so affected by his work, and I also look at a lesser known story, of  how art became an unlikely player in the Cold War and the global contest of ideas. How Abstract Expressionism was enlisted as an unknowing agent in a shadowy propaganda war, bankrolled by the CIA, to sell the story of freedom… and capitalism.

Currently the anti-adblock stuff is being A/B tested, and one of my accounts is in the experimental group. I wrote a filter that partially avoids one of the anti-adblock measures, fake buffering, on uBlock Origin (and Brave browser, since it uses the same filter rules). (It’s already in the default filter lists, you don’t need to manually add the filter.)One thing that people have ran into is “fake buffering”, where videos will take a while to load due to a lot of buffering, but only at the very start of the video (there’s no mid-video fake buffering). As I’ll explain, the fake buffering is 80% of the length of the ads you would’ve seen, so even with fake buffering you’re still saving time using an adblocker.InnerTube is YouTube’s first party internal API that the web client and mobile apps use to interact with videos and get details about them. InnerTube endpoints look like https://www.youtube.com/youtubei/. One of those endpoints is , which the web client calls when you click on a video to get data about the URL and GVS stream URLs.GVS (Google Video Services) is a service that serves video streams for YouTube, Google Drive, and Google Photos. To stream a video from GVS, you need to get a GVS  URL from InnerTube (or the Drive/Photos internal API). GVS URLs are signed and have an expiry time (usually 6 hours), so you can’t construct them on your own, you need to get one from InnerTube. One weird thing about GVS is that it isn’t only hosted from Google’s data center: ISPs can put Google Global Cache servers in their infrastructure so that they can serve YouTube videos without needing to send traffic outside the ISP’s network (only public/unlisted YouTube videos are served by GGC; private YT videos and Drive/Photos videos are always served from Google data centers). GVS URLs look like https://rr1---sn-gvbxgn-tt1e6.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?expire=1750321185&... (but with a lot more query parameters).Originally the web client streamed video by just using some query parameters to the GVS URL to specify what range of video it wanted, and GVS responded with the video contents for that range. But for complicated reasons, YouTube decided to improve on this with SABR (Server ABR (Adaptive Bit Rate)), which is YouTube’s proprietary binary protocol for streaming video data, which is better at avoiding buffering than today’s open formats (e.g. MPEG-DASH). One thing that SABR supports is the server sending a backoff to the client, instructing the client to wait some amount of time before trying again instead of sending video/audio data.The source of fake bufferingWhat’s happening is that InnerTube is providing GVS streams that will give a backoff of 80% of the ad duration for ads for the first  request (for the content video, not the ads), so for example if the ad is 15 seconds you’ll get 12 seconds of backoff when blocking ads. If you have an unskippable 6 second ad AND a 15 second unskippable ad together the backoff will be 16.8 seconds. To be clear this isn’t server-side ad insertion; the ad and content streams are still separate (YouTube  doing a server-side ad insertion experiment, but that’s separate from fake buffering). The “Experiencing interruptions” dialogs are likely triggered by long backoffs from GVS.This backoff  happen if you’re in the A/B test, regardless of if YouTube thinks you’re using an adblocker. You just don’t notice it if you’re not blocking ads, because the web client starts loading the content video while the ad plays, so the only difference for non-ad-blocking users is that the content video doesn’t start buffering until the ad is 80% over.I’ve seen claims online that YouTube is “DAMAGING Computers By SPIKING CPU Usage If You Use Ad Block”. This is completely false; YouTube doesn’t use CPU usage waiting for the backoff to expire (and even if they used a spinloop to implement the wait, maxing a single core for <30 seconds won’t damage any CPU).How can you avoid getting backoffed until the unskippable ad is over? Don’t get served an ad in the first place. If you set the playbackContext.contentPlaybackContext.isInlinePlaybackNoAd property in player requests to true, InnerTube won’t serve you any ads and thus won’t include any backoff in the GVS streams.We can write a filter rule that makes it so whenever the web client stringifies JSON bound for a server request, we add "isInlinePlaybackNoAd":true to the stringified JSON.How did I know to set that property? It’s referenced in the frontend JavaScript, so I could have spent a bunch of time reading all that. But there’s an easier way - while the web client interacts with InnerTube using JSON, that JSON API is actually generated from a Protocol Buffers definition, and there’s a way you can extract most of the underlying protobuf definition. I used req2proto, which is a tool to extract protobuf definitions from Google’s internal APIs to get the full definitions used in the  call, and used that to find the  property.This method only works for warm navigation, where you’ve already loaded the YouTube single page app and are clicking around within it. When you navigate directly to a watch page, the YouTube backend embeds a player response directly into the page as . Since the player request is made on the backend, we can’t set  on it.  One way to fix this for cold loads is to just remove that initial data to force YouTube to make a player request we can control (but see below before using these):This approach has some problems though, so you might not want to use it:It completely breaks livestreams, and probably some other things I haven’t testedIt causes the video player to briefly flashIt slows the page loading timeBypassing the locker scriptSo that filter kinda worked, but sometimes uBlock Origin wasn’t hooking . I investigated further and it turns out YouTube is running an A/B test where sometimes they add this to the frontend HTML as the very first thing in the  tag:This locks a few global objects by using  to set them as non-writable, which prevents later code from overwriting them with a Proxy that alters their behaviour. So uBlock Origin can only proxy JSON.stringify if it can run before this locker script does. On Firefox this is easily resolvable - you can use a HTML filter to filter out the script tag from the source HTML before the page even starts being parsed. But that relies on extension APIs that Chromium doesn’t support.The “fix” for the locker script so far is to hook  instead of .  is another function that handles the request body before it gets fetched. It would be nice if there was a way to actually defuse the locker script, instead of working around it. The version of the filter that hooks  instead is more complicated because uBO’s scriptlets don’t let you replace text on a key of an object, so the filter in uBO’s filter list injects this JS:Thanks to the uAssets maintainers for helping with that.If you have any questions for me you can DM me on Discord as .]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Nxtscape – an open-source agentic browser</title><link>https://github.com/nxtscape/nxtscape</link><author>felarof</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 16:35:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi HN - we're Nithin and Nikhil, twin brothers and founders of nxtscape.ai (YC S24). We're building Nxtscape ("next-scape") - an open-source, agentic browser for the AI era.-- Why bother building a new browser?
For the first time since Netscape was released in 1994, it feels like we can reimagine browsers from scratch for the age of AI agents. The web browser of tomorrow might not look like what we have today.We saw how tools like Cursor gave developers a 10x productivity boost, yet the browser—where everyone else spends their entire workday—hasn't fundamentally changed.And honestly, we feel like we're constantly fighting the browser we use every day. It's not one big thing, but a series of small, constant frustrations. I'll have 70+ tabs open from three different projects and completely lose my train of thought. And simple stuff like reordering tide pods from amazon or filling out forms shouldn't need our full attention anymore. AI can handle all of this, and that's exactly what we're building.-- What makes us different
We know others are exploring this space (Perplexity, Dia), but we want to build something open-source and community-driven. We're not a search or ads company, so we can focus on being privacy-first – Ollama integration, BYOK (Bring Your Own Keys), ad-blocker.Btw we love what Brave started and stood for, but they've now spread themselves too thin across crypto, search, etc. We are laser-focused on one thing: making browsers work for YOU with AI. And unlike Arc (which we loved too but got abandoned), we're 100% open source. Fork us if you don't like our direction.-- Our journey hacking a new browser
To build this, we had to fork Chromium. Honestly, it feels like the only viable path today—we've seen others like Brave (started with electron) and Microsoft Edge learn this the hard way.We also started with why not just build an extension. But realized we needed more control. Similar to the reason why Cursor forked VSCode. For example, Chrome has this thing called the Accessibility Tree - basically a cleaner, semantic version of the DOM that screen readers use. Perfect for AI agents to understand pages, but you can't use it through extension APIs.That said, working with the 15M-line C++ chromium codebase has been an adventure. We've both worked on infra at Google and Meta, but Chromium is a different beast. Tools like Cursor's indexing completely break at this scale, so we've had to get really good with grep and vim. And the build times are brutal—even with our maxed-out M4 Max MacBook, a full build takes about 3 hours.Full disclosure: we are still very early, but we have a working prototype on GitHub. It includes an early version of a "local Manus" style agent that can automate simple web tasks, plus an AI sidebar for questions, and other productivity features (grouping tabs, saving/resuming sessions, etc.).Looking forward to any and all comments!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Video Friday: Jet-Powered Humanoid Robot Lifts Off</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/video-friday-jet-powered-robot</link><author>Evan Ackerman</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTA3OTIxOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4NjU5MDcyN30.wsRqyiMeNZMeGSYPpph2sEggJXX1os1LxSc7npV72IQ/image.jpg?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 16:30:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Your weekly selection of awesome robot videos]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Pickaxe – A TypeScript library for building AI agents</title><link>https://github.com/hatchet-dev/pickaxe</link><author>abelanger</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 16:07:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey HN, Gabe and Alexander here from Hatchet. Today we're releasing Pickaxe, a Typescript library to build AI agents which are scalable and fault-tolerant.Pickaxe provides a simple set of primitives for building agents which can automatically checkpoint their state and suspend or resume processing (also known as durable execution) while waiting for external events (like a human in the loop). The library is based on common patterns we've seen when helping Hatchet users run millions of agent executions per day.Unlike other tools, Pickaxe is not a framework. It does not have any opinions or abstractions for implementing agent memory, prompting, context, or calling LLMs directly. Its only focus is making AI agents more observable and reliable.As agents start to scale, there are generally three big problems that emerge:
1. Agents are long-running compared to other parts of your application. Extremely long-running processes are tricky because deploying new infra or hitting request timeouts on serverless runtimes will interrupt their execution. 
2. They are stateful: they generally store internal state which governs the next step in the execution path
3. They require access to lots of fresh data, which can either be queried during agent execution or needs to be continuously refreshed from a data source.(These problems are more specific to agents which execute remotely -- locally running agents generally don't have these problems)Pickaxe is designed to solve these issues by providing a simple API which wraps durable execution infrastructure for agents. Durable execution is a way of automatically checkpointing the state of a process, so that if the process fails, it can automatically be replayed from the checkpoint, rather than starting over from the beginning. This model is also particularly useful when your agent needs to wait for an external event or human review in order to continue execution. To support this pattern, Pickaxe uses a Hatchet feature called `waitFor` which durably registers a listener for an event, which means that even if the agent isn't actively listening for the event, it is guaranteed to be processed by Hatchet and stored in the execution history and resume processing. This infrastructure is powered by what is essentially a linear event log, which stores the entire execution history of an agent in a Postgres database managed by Hatchet.We'd greatly appreciate any feedback you have and hope you get the chance to try out Pickaxe.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Brexit remorse - Was leaving the EU a mistake? | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMgr7nZ-eMA</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/dMgr7nZ-eMA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 16:01:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom voted in a referendum to leave the EU. In 2020, the exit took place. Years later, none of the Brexit promises have been kept.

In the face of a deep economic and social crisis, many Britons now believe that leaving the European Union was a mistake. There is a great deal of anger in society, cutting across all generations. The anger is felt both among those who voted for Brexit, and those who voted to remain in the European Union. 

Since the referendum, five prime ministers have resigned in succession -- four of them with a bang --because they were unable to fulfill their populist promises. How did this political chaos come about?

Many Britons are now talking about "Bregret” -  regret about the exit. The film explores the future of this increasingly divided kingdom. What legacy will former Prime Minister Boris Johnson leave behind? What direction will the country take, in this complex transition period? 

From initial hope to current regret, this investigation provides a detailed overview of the post-Brexit era in the UK.

For the past several months, I’ve been working on a skunkworks project at Fly.io, and it’s time to show it off.I wanted LLM agents to work just as well with Elixir as they do with Python and JavaScript. Last December, in order to figure out what that was going to take, I started a little weekend project to find out how difficult it would be to build a coding agent in Elixir.A few weeks later, I had it spitting out working Phoenix applications and driving a full in-browser IDE. I knew this wasn’t going to stay a weekend project.If you follow me on Twitter, you’ve probably seen me teasing this work as it picked up steam. We’re at a point where we’re pretty serious about this thing, and so it’s time to make a formal introduction.World, meet Phoenix.new, a batteries-included fully-online coding agent tailored to Elixir and Phoenix. I think it’s going to be the fastest way to build collaborative, real-time applications.First, even though it runs entirely in your browser, Phoenix.new gives both you and your agent a root shell, in an ephemeral virtual machine (a Fly Machine) that gives our agent loop free rein to install things and run programs  — without any risk of messing up your local machine. You don’t think about any of this; you just open up the VSCode interface, push the shell button, and there you are, on the isolated machine you share with the Phoenix.new agent.Second, it’s an agent system I built specifically for Phoenix. Phoenix is about real-time collaborative applications, and Phoenix.new knows what that means. To that end, Phoenix.new includes, in both its UI and its agent tools, a full browser. The Phoenix.new agent uses that browser “headlessly” to check its own front-end changes and interact with the app. Because it’s a full browser, instead of trying to iterate on screenshots, the agent sees real page content and JavaScript state – with or without a human present.Agents build software the way you did when you first got started, the way you still do today when you prototype things. They don’t carefully design Docker container layers and they don’t really do release cycles. An agent wants to pop a shell and get its fingernails dirty.A fully isolated virtual machine means Phoenix.new’s fingernails can get  If it wants to add a package to , it can do that and then run  or  and check the output. Sure. Every agent can do that. But if it wants to add an APT package to the base operating system, it can do that too, and make sure it worked. It owns the whole environment.This offloads a huge amount of tedious, repetitive work.At his AI Startup School talk last week, Andrej Karpathy related his experience of building a restaurant menu visualizer, which takes camera pictures of text menus and transforms all the menu items into pictures. The code, which he vibe-coded with an LLM agent, was the easy part; he had it working in an afternoon. But getting the app online took him a whole week.With Phoenix.new, I’m taking dead aim at this problem. The apps we produce live in the cloud from the minute they launch. They have private, shareable URLs (we detect anything the agent generates with a bound port and give it a preview URL underneath , with integrated port-forwarding), they integrate with Github, and they inherit all the infrastructure guardrails of Fly.io: hardware virtualization, WireGuard, and isolated networks.Github’s  CLI is installed by default. So the agent knows how to clone any repo, or browse issues, and you can even authorize it for internal repositories to get it working with your team’s existing projects and dependencies.Full control of the environment also closes the loop between the agent and deployment. When Phoenix.new boots an app, it watches the logs, and tests the application. When an action triggers an error, Phoenix.new notices and gets to work.Phoenix.new can interact with web applications the way users do: with a real browser.The Phoenix.new environment includes a headless Chrome browser that our agent knows how to drive. Prompt it to add a front-end feature to your application, and it won’t just sketch the code out and make sure it compiles and lints. It’ll pull the app up itself and poke at the UI, simultaneously looking at the page content, JavaScript state, and server-side logs.Phoenix is all about “live” real-time interactivity, and gives us seamless live reload. The user interface for Phoenix.new itself includes a live preview of the app being worked on, so you can kick back and watch it build front-end features incrementally. Any other  tabs you have open also update as it goes. It’s wild.Phoenix.new can already build real, full-stack applications with WebSockets, Phoenix’s Presence features, and real databases. I’m seeing it succeed at business and collaborative applications right now.But there’s no fixed bound on the tasks you can reasonably ask it to accomplish. If you can do it with a shell and a browser, I want Phoenix.new to do it too. And it can do these tasks with or without you present.For example: set a  and tell the agent about it. The agent knows enough to go explore it with , and it’ll propose apps based on the schemas it finds. It can model Ecto schemas off the database. And if MySQL is your thing, the agent will just  a MySQL client and go to town.Frontier model LLMs have vast world knowledge. They generalize extremely well. At ElixirConfEU, I did a demo vibe-coding Tetris on stage. Phoenix.new nailed it, first try, first prompt. It’s not like there’s gobs of Phoenix LiveView Tetris examples floating around the Internet! But lots of people have published Tetris code, and lots of people have written LiveView stuff, and 2025 LLMs can connect those dots.At this point you might be wondering – can I just ask it to build a Rails app? Or an Expo React Native app? Or Svelte? Or Go?Our system prompt is tuned for Phoenix today, but all languages you care about are already installed. We’re still figuring out where to take this, but adding new languages and frameworks definitely ranks highly in my plans.Agents can do real work, today, with or without a human present. Buckle up: the future of development, at least in the common case, probably looks less like cracking open a shell and finding a file to edit, and more like popping into a CI environment with agents working away around the clock.Local development isn’t going away. But there’s going to be a shift in where the majority of our iterations take place. I’m already using Phoenix.new to triage  Github issues and pick problems to solve. I close my laptop, grab a cup of coffee, and wait for a PR to arrive — Phoenix.new knows how PRs work, too. We’re already here, and this space is just getting started.This isn’t where I thought I’d end up when I started poking around. The Phoenix and LiveView journey was much the same. Something special was there and the projects took on a life of their own. I’m excited to share this work now, and see where it might take us. I can’t wait to see what folks build.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Blind &amp; Visually Impaired Initiative (BVI) Meeting - 2025-06-17</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVgyZVyUvc</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/pcVgyZVyUvc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 14:30:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

But one of the biggest challenges facing businesses today, that I particularly care about, is how to unlock the true potential of AI by leveraging a company’s operational business data. At Snow Leopard, we aim to bridge the gap between AI systems and critical business data that is locked away in databases, data warehouses, and other API-based systems, so enterprises can use live business data from any data source – whether it's database, warehouse, or APIs – in real time and on demand, natively. In this interview, I'd like to cover Snow Leopard’s intelligent data retrieval approach that can leverage business data directly and on-demand to make AI work.Deepti is the founder and CEO of Snow Leopard AI, a platform that helps teams build AI apps using their live business data, on-demand. She has nearly 2 decades of experience in data platforms and infrastructure.As Head of Product at Observable, Deepti led the 0→1 product and GTM strategy in the crowded data analytics market. Before that, Deepti was the founding PM for Google Spanner, growing it to thousands of internal customers (Ads, PlayStore, Gmail, etc.), before launching it externally as a seminal cloud database service.

Standardizing Authentication Flows in Keycloak Environments – Efficient Authorization Strategies Using OPA - Yuta Kato, CyberAgent, Inc.

In this session, we will explain how we standardized and streamlined authentication flows to address the growing workload faced by engineers due to the rapid increase in authentication services.

To tackle the challenging task of building individual authentication flows for over 100 services, we adopted an implementation approach that defines authorization levels using role information and leverages attribute data stored in Keycloak.

By accurately linking user information with imported role data and standardizing authentication flows, we enabled faster updates to authorization systems. Additionally, we implemented centralized policy management for each client using OPA (Open Policy Agent) and policy language, significantly improving maintenance efficiency.

This session will provide practical and scalable design strategies and implementation methods for building robust systems that address authorization strategies using OPA.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Sponsored Keynote: Hitachi’s Keycloak Journey - Evolution of Business and Community - Michito Okai</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUR9_gZZOfY</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/dUR9_gZZOfY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 13:49:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

How To Manage Keycloak Securely by Using Terraform on Google Cloud - Atsushi Kitano, Cloud Ace

We have launched a new service which monitors customers' systems.
It uses Keycloak to authenticate for customers and developers to use our service components, for instance, Grafana, ArgoCD, Backstage, Redmine, and so on.

So, Keycloak has personal information, and we have to manage it securely.
We're using Terraform to configure Keycloak, not for making mistakes due to creating by hand. And we don't want to encounter errors when running Terraform code from the developer's PC.
So we're running it from the CD agent. We use Cloud Build, a Google Cloud product, because it provides a private pool that allows us to use a specific IP address.

We'll introduce how to build this CD system and how to use Terraform in my session.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>No More Configuration Confusion!

OpenID Federation Trust Chain on Keycloak for Highly Assured Use Cases of Digital Identity Wallet - Yutaka Obuchi, Hitachi

OpenID Federation 1.0 provides a framework to build trust between a Relying Party and an OpenID Provider that have no direct relationship so that the Relying Party can send OIDC/OAuth requests to the OpenID Provider without being previously registered.

One primary use case is the trust between an Issuer and a Holder (Wallet) on W3C’s Verifiable Credential Data Model, which is getting a lot of attentions as an approach to realize the Digital Identity Wallet ecosystem.
Especially when high assurance level is needed like EU Digital Identity Wallet, OpenID Federation can provide a strong solution.

In this session:
Firstly I will explain OpenID Federation and the reason why it is important for Digital Identity Wallet ecosystem.
Then I will explain what types of roles Keycloak can play with OpenID Federation Trust Chain.
Also I will show a simple demo of client registration with OpenID Federation Trust Chain on Keycloak.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Keynote: AI Agents with Keycloak in MCP - Takashi Norimatsu, Senior OSS Specialist, Hitachi Ltd.</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CsygNAJt-0</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/-CsygNAJt-0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 13:49:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

Keynote: AI Agents with Keycloak in MCP - Takashi Norimatsu, Senior OSS Specialist, Hitachi Ltd.

In this talk, Takashi investigates the possibility of integrating Keycloak with AI agents.
In the field of AI agents, Model Context Protocol (MCP) becomes a hot topic, which makes it easy for an AI agent/tool to connect internal/external services.

When an AI agent/tool implementing an MCP client accesses a remote external service implementing an MCP server, end user authentication and authorization is sometimes required. According to the MCP specification, OAuth 2.1 needs to be used for that, which implies that there is the possibility of using Keycloak for end user authentication and authorization because Keycloak supported OAuth 2.1.

Firstly, Takashi talks about MCP briefly and describes end user authentication and authorization of MCP in more detail. After that, the speaker shows the possible system configuration that includes Keycloak as a part of the MCP server.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Obviously True Theorem No One Can Prove</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x32Zq-XvID4</link><author>Veritasium</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/x32Zq-XvID4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 13:01:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA">Veritasium</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This deceptively simple math problem has stumped mathematicians for almost 300 years! 👉 Head to https://hensonshaving.com/veritasium and enter code 'Veritasium' for 100 free blades with the purchase of a razor.

ABSTRACT
Web developers: AI offers a fantastic opportunity to make your web UIs genuinely more intelligent and productive than before. But don't just throw on a chatbot and call it done, as people may not even use it. Let's explore how language models can integrate into your existing web UIs, anticipating your users' needs and completing their tasks faster.

While this is a technical, demo-centric talk, it isn't about how LLMs or transformers work internally, nor just how to use Open AI SDKs from a particular language. Instead, it focuses on practical, end-to-end uses for AI in web apps, making your users happier and more productive. [...]

Typically reviewers prefer a larger quantity of smaller changes versus a smaller quantity of larger changes. Sometimes it gets really messy to break up a change into sufficiently small PRs, so thoughtful commits are a great way of further subdividing changes in PRs. It can be pretty time consuming to do this though, so this tool automates the process with the help of AI.The tool sends the diff of your git branch against a base branch to an LLM provider. The LLM provider responds with a set of suggested commits with sensible commit messages, change groupings, and descriptions. When you explicitly accept the proposed changes, the tool re-writes the commit history on your branch to match the LLM's suggestion. Then you can force push your branch to your remote to make it match.The default AI provider is your locally running Ollama server. Cloud providers can be explicitly configured via CLI argument or in a config file, but keeping local models as the default helps to protect against unintentional data sharing. The tool always creates a backup branch in case you need to easily revert in case of changing your mind or an error in commit re-writing. Note that re-writing commit history to a remote branch requires a force push, which is something your team/org will need to be ok with. As long as you are working on a feature branch this is usually fine, but it's always worth checking if you are not sure.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Ts-SSH – SSH over Tailscale without running the daemon</title><link>https://github.com/derekg/ts-ssh</link><author>i8code</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 03:03:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ts-ssh solves a specific problem: accessing machines on your Tailnet from
  environments where you can't install the full Tailscale daemon (like CI/CD runners or
   restricted systems).  It uses Tailscale's tsnet library to establish userspace connectivity, then provides
  a standard SSH experience. Works with existing workflows since it supports normal SSH
   features like ProxyCommand, key auth, and terminal handling.

  Some features that proved useful:
  • Parallel command execution across multiple hosts
  • Built-in tmux session management for multi-host work
  • SCP-style file transfers
  • Works on Linux/macOS/Windows (AMD64 and ARM64)

  The codebase is interesting from a development perspective - it was written almost
  entirely using AI tools (mainly Claude Code, with some OpenAI and Jules). Not as an
  experiment, but because it actually worked well for this kind of systems programming.
   Happy to discuss the workflow if anyone's curious about that aspect.

  Source and binaries are on GitHub. Would appreciate feedback from anyone dealing with
   similar connectivity challenges.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Mysteries of Easter Island</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/the-mysteries-of-easter-island</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/68528d70259ce49e3e5b26ef/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=Bzgx63z2s3e3Fdm9aMnkEBavEUONpdLV2t2CyF4STi4" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 23:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In the heart of the Pacific Ocean, over 2,000 miles from the nearest continent, lies one of the world’s most iconic archaeological treasure troves - Rapa Nui, known to the outside world as Easter Island.

So I have spent my free time these last 3 months writing one! Now I think it has enough features to present it to the world (and a docker image to give it a quick try).I know some people see trackers as relics of the past now that DHT and PEX are common but I think they still serve a purpose in today's Internet (purely talking about public trackers). That said there is not a lot going on in terms of new developments since everyone just throws opentracker in a vps a calls it a day (honorable exceptions: aquatic and torrust).I plan to continue development for the foreseeable future and add some (optional) esoteric features along the way so if anyone currently operates a tracker please give a try and enjoy the lack of crashes.note: only swarm_printout.ex has been vibe coded, the rest has all been written by hand.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Is Our Universe Inside a Black Hole?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKeCr-MAyH4</link><author>StarTalk</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/vKeCr-MAyH4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 22:34:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoAEDirJPjEUFcF2FklnBA">StarTalk</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Is our universe inside a black hole?

You define your data model using SQLAlchemy, APIs, or custom logic, and EnrichMCP turns it into a type-safe, introspectable interface that agents can discover, traverse, and invoke.It auto-generates tools from your models, validates all I/O with Pydantic, handles relationships, and supports schema discovery. Agents can go from user → orders → product naturally, just like a developer navigating an ORM.We use this internally to let agents query production systems, call APIs, apply business logic, and even integrate ML models.

Four siblings who survived this genocide tell of violence and captivity, but also of courage and new beginnings.

August 2024 marked the tenth anniversary of the IS genocide against the Yazidis. The terrorist militia tried to wipe out the religious minority in 2014. The film follows four siblings of Yazidi origin who sought refuge in Germany after the events in Iraq. Their personal stories provide deep insights into the traumas they suffered and their struggle for a new life. 
Between hope for return, the longing for peace, the fight for justice and the celebration of life, the film also deals with the essence of being human: the urge for freedom and autonomy, and the importance of individual dignity.

Now, in the midst of a new war unfolding between the two countries, they appear to be bent on burning Iran's financial system.Predatory Sparrow, which often goes by its Farsi name, Gonjeshke Darande, in an effort to appear as a homegrown hacktivist organization, announced in a post on on its X account Wednesday that it had targeted the Iranian crypto exchange Nobitex, accusing the exchange of enabling sanctions violations and terrorist financing on behalf of the Iranian regime. According to cryptocurrency tracing firm Elliptic, the hackers destroyed more than $90 million in Nobitex holdings, a rare instance of hackers burning crypto assets rather than stealing them.“These cyberattacks are the result of Nobitex being a key regime tool for financing terrorism and violating sanctions,” the hackers posted to X. “Associating with regime terror financing and sanction violation infrastructure puts your assets at risk.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Do Planets Rotate in a Disk?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/6TcFvx8ajD4</link><author>Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/6TcFvx8ajD4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 14:00:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q">Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Why do all planets orbit in the same flat plane?

DESCRIPTION
Abby Bangser (Principal Engineer at Syntasso) speaks with Kief Morris (Distinguished Engineer at Thoughtworks consultant and Author of "Infrastructure as Code") about the evolution of infrastructure as code over the past decade. They discuss how the field has grown from simple server configuration management to complex cloud architectures, the challenges of current tooling, and emerging solutions like System Initiative.

The conversation explores the importance of abstraction layers, the application of software development principles to infrastructure, and how AI might transform the field. They emphasize that infrastructure decisions must align with business needs rather than being treated as generic plumbing, highlighting the ongoing need for platform engineering and developer experience considerations.

GamingOnLinux reports: For some context here: originally, Proton had an option to enable / disable it globally. That was removed with the Game Recording update last year. That made sense, because people kept somehow turning it entirely off and now it's required by Steam. Currently, there's still an option in the stable Steam Client that you need to manually check to enable Steam Play (Proton) for "all other titles". This is something of a leftover from when Proton was initially revealed, and only worked for a specific set of games on Valve's whitelist. It now covers what Valve set by default for Steam Deck and SteamOS verification.
 
What's changed is that at some point in the recent Steam Beta releases, is that "for all other titles" option is gone. I've scrolled back through changelogs and not seen it mentioned. So now, Proton is just enabled properly in full by default in the Steam Beta like shown in the [image here]. This is a good (and needed) change that I'm happy to see. There's often confusion when people try to run Windows games on Linux and end up with no install button because Proton isn't turned on for all titles. [This] will soon be a thing of the past. To be clear, this is not setting Proton on every game by default, it does not override Native Linux games. It's just making Proton available by default.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Emulating Retro Games on Modern Consoles with Robin Lavallée and Bill Litshauer</title><link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/06/19/emulating-retro-games-on-modern-consoles-with-robin-lavallee-and-bill-litshauer/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=emulating-retro-games-on-modern-consoles-with-robin-lavallee-and-bill-litshauer</link><author>SEDaily</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://traffic.megaphone.fm/SED6754568495.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 09:00:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/podcast/">Podcast - Software Engineering Daily</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Emulating retro games on modern consoles is a growing trend, and allows players to experience classic titles with improved performance, enhanced resolution, and added features like save states and rewinding.

Velociraptors were closer in size to turkeys than the towering predators seen in movies, but could giant raptors have actually existed? Palaeontologist Jim Kirkland believes so, based on one single claw. Years of digging in the Utah desert finally led to a massive discovery: the bones of the Utahraptor, a predator the size of a school bus. But what made this raptor grow so much larger than its cousins? Join us as we uncover the prehistoric puzzle behind one of the largest raptors ever found.

Built as a three-player co-op PvE first-person shooter set in the Oldest House--the same setting as 2019's Control--Firebreak manages to transpose Remedy's signature strangeness onto something new, and the more I played it, the more I enjoyed it, though it has its fair share of issues.The story casts players as formerly pencil-pushing Federal Bureau of Control (FBC) employees who have no choice but to create makeshift weaponry and gear to combat the Hiss threat they're trapped in the Oldest House with. This premise gives the game a colorful and comedic tone, where expendable player-characters chirp about needing to fill out workplace forms and worry about overtime pay despite the chaotic circumstances they find themselves in. Firebreak sits at the intersection of the FBC's inherent bureaucracy and its impromptu DIY, punk-rock showdown with supernatural monsters. It's a tone that feels decidedly Remedy-like, and its class-based combat does well to match that weirdness.Three "Crisis Kits" make up the game's classes. There's the Fix Kit, which is equipped with a giant wrench and can repair things like lighting, breaker boxes, and healing showers. The Jump Kit, which comes with an electro-shocking contraption that would look at home in Ghostbusters, can be used to shock enemies and power various electronic devices, like broken fans in the game's earliest mission. Lastly, the Splash Kit comes with a big water gun that can shoot bubbles of water to put out fires or dilute negative status effects from one's self or teammates. Naturally, this one pairs well with the Jump Kit, too, as soaking and then shocking enemies can be an effective way of reducing their numbers.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2339 - Luis J.

These stablemates were the backbone of the US bombing strategy in Europe, flying daylight missions with the Eighth Air Force in England and the 15th Air Force in Italy.  

On paper, they’re a good match. Both are four-engine heavy bombers with similar crew positions, speed, range, and bomb loads. But - put their performance under the microscope, and you’ll quickly see that these are two very different aircraft with two very different reputations.  

But which bomber had the edge – the B-17 or the B-24?

The birch plays a special role in this boreal coniferous forest. Its light-colored bark forms a perfect insulating layer. Symbiotic fungi protect its roots from attackers.

In the boreal coniferous forest, where light and darkness, warmth and cold follow each other in an eternal cycle, a sacred tree watches over the inhabitants of the taiga: the birch. With its strong roots and tall crown, this special tree is a symbol of life. The northern Finnish Sami people revere it as a source of inspiration, a resource and a medicinal plant; its wood is used for heating, its bark sap as a medicinal essence and its branches for carving bows. Particularly long-lived trees are treated as oracles, and consulted on existential matters.

The tree’s light-colored bark blends into the snow-covered landscape in winter, camouflaging the trees and protecting them from foraging hares and reindeer. The white trunk also helps to prevent the snow around the base of the tree from thawing too quickly, thereby protecting its roots from the cold. In summer, it reflects the sunlight and reduces heat absorption on hot days.

Like the birch, other creatures here have also developed strategies to survive under extreme conditions. Lichens are more than just decoration in the boreal coniferous forest: the fungi insulate the soil, and serve as food for reindeer and building material for the nests of Arctic birds. Reindeer, on the other hand, are the landscape gardeners of the taiga: they cut the tasty shoots of ash and larch trees and thus regulate the forest in a natural way. When they roll on the ground, they create small hollows where rainwater can collect; their droppings serve as fertilizer and they transport tree and shrub seeds under their hooves. In the boreal coniferous forest, storms occur frequently throughout the year; the natural flexibility of the birch proves to be an advantage here. Fallen trees also contribute to biodiversity by uncovering mineral soil and exposing it to sunlight so that new life can develop.

But increasingly extreme summer heatwaves are threatening the fragile ecosystem of the boreal coniferous forest. Animal and plant species must adapt - or migrate further north to escape extinction.

The more we want God to exist, the more we must question so-called ‘proofs’ of God’s existence. God likely appreciates skeptics, those who genuinely seek and genuinely doubt. Skeptics provide real service: they help clear up or clean out poor arguments for God. Is it possible all the ‘God arguments’ are bad?

ABSTRACT
Rust is modern programming language that is only growing in popularity. It is often lauded for its approach to memory safety, particularly through making previously implicit concepts like data ownership explicit. On top of it comes a powerful reference validation system, the borrow checker.

However, Rust is often reduced to those two concepts. This talk will give an accessible overview to using Rust core principles - Ownership and Borrowing - together with other, lesser known concepts of the language to build safe and efficient APIs.

For Rust practicioners, this talk gives insight into known concepts in more detail. It does so by looking at examples from the Rust standard library first and foremost. For people who don't practice Rust regularly, it gives an insight into properties of the language that are less spoken about. [...]

You will find references at the bottom of this page if you want to go deeper.Once upon a time, computers had a single CPU and could run only one task at a time.Still it completed tasks faster than humans.Yet the system wasted CPU time waiting for input-output () responses, such as keyboard input. And the system became slow and non-responsive as the number of tasks grew.So they set up a scheduler and broke down each task into smaller parts.The scheduler assigns a specific time for processing each task and then moves to another. Put simply, the CPU runs those micro tasks in an interleaved order.The technique of switching between different tasks at once is called .But concurrency only creates an illusion of parallel execution. The performance worsens when the number of tasks increases. Because each task has to wait for its turn, causing an extra delay.So they added extra CPU cores. And each CPU core could run a task independently.Think of the  as a processing unit within the CPU; it handles instructions.The technique of handling many tasks at once is called  It offers efficiency.CodeRabbit is your AI-powered code review co-pilot. It gives you instant, contextual feedback on every PR and one-click fix suggestions. It has reviewed over 10 million PRs and is used in 1 million repositories. Besides, it’s free to use for open-source repos; 70K+ open-source projects already use it.CodeRabbit lets you instantly spot:Security issues (XSS, SQL injection, CSRF)Concurrency problems (deadlocks, race conditions)Code smells & readability concernsBest practice violations (SOLID, DRY, KISS)Weak test coverage & performance bottlenecksWrite clean, secure, and performant code with CodeRabbit.Concurrency Is Not ParallelismConcurrency is about the design, while parallelism is about the execution model.1. Concurrency vs ParallelismImagine  as a chef making doner kebab for 3 customers. He switches between fries, meat, and vegetables. And consider  as 3 chefs making doner kebab for 3 customers; all done at the same time.The CPU-intensive tasks run efficiently with parallelism.Yet parallelism wastes CPU time when there are I/O heavy tasks.Also running tasks on different CPUs doesn’t always speed them up. Because coordinating tasks for independent execution is necessary.So combine concurrency with parallelism to build efficient, scalable, and responsive systems.Besides simultaneous changes to the same data might corrupt it.Yet it’s difficult to determine when a thread will get scheduled or which instructions it’ll run.So it’s necessary to use synchronization techniques, such as locking.Think of a  as the smallest processing unit scheduled by the operating system.A thread must acquire the lock to do a set of operations. While another thread can use the CPU only after the current thread releases the lock.The 2 popular synchronization primitives are mutex and semaphore. They’re used to coordinate access to a shared resource.A mutex allows only 1 thread to access the shared resource at a time. While semaphore limits the number of threads accessing a shared resource at a time.Imagine the  as a single key to enter the building. And think of the  as a bowl of keys to enter a building.Besides programming languages, such as Go, allow to build concurrent and parallel solutions without explicit locking mechanisms.Here are some use cases of concurrency and parallelism in system design:A client fetches data via asynchronous callbacks. While main thread handles user input to keep the UI responsive.A load balancer uses non-blocking I/O or a thread pool to avoid connection queuing. A server uses event-driven or multi-threading models to handle requests. Also many servers could be installed for parallelism.A connection pooler allows clients to share a set of database connections. While queries get executed in parallel across those connections.A sharded database allows clients to make parallel queries and then merge the responses. Besides the client could access and change data at once using database concurrency techniques.Concurrency is not parallelism; instead, it’s a way of structuring tasks to enable parallelism. Thus making it easy to scale.One should break down a problem into smaller, independent tasks for concurrency. Then compose the smaller tasks in parallel to solve the problem efficiently.Remember, a system in which all tasks run in parallel and stay busy all the time has the maximum throughput.Subscribe to get simplified case studies delivered straight to your inbox:Want to advertise in this newsletter? 📰Thank you for supporting this newsletter.You are now 154,001+ readers strong, very close to 155k.

"The idea is to point to sources of text, images and video that were created prior to the explosion of AI-generated content," Graham-Cumming wrote on his blog last week. The reason? To preserve what made non-AI media uniquely human.The archive name comes from a scientific phenomenon from the Cold War era. After nuclear weapons testing began in 1945, atmospheric radiation contaminated new steel production worldwide. For decades, scientists needing radiation-free metal for sensitive instruments had to salvage steel from pre-war shipwrecks. Scientists called this steel "low-background steel." Graham-Cumming sees a parallel with today's web, where AI-generated content increasingly mingles with human-created material and contaminates it.With the advent of generative AI models like ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion in 2022, it has become far more difficult for researchers to ensure that media found on the Internet was created by humans without using AI tools. ChatGPT in particular triggered an avalanche of AI-generated text across the web, forcing at least one research project to shut down entirely.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why did Germany fight to the last man?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/RwX-zY9ZqTI</link><author>Imperial War Museums</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/RwX-zY9ZqTI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 11:00:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3uAjWoLZ4bSi6qI9SjALxA">Imperial War Museums</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Iran Has More Missiles Than Israel Has Interceptors.

Can you measure time without something moving? Neil deGrasse Tyson and comedian Chuck Nice tackle your cosmic questions, from the Silurian Hypothesis to singularities to the edge of the known universe. 

We ponder the relationship between time and motion. Does all time require motion, or can it exist on its own? Can you measure time without something that repeats?  Then, Neil sheepishly recommends a book every 12-year-old should read (yes, it’s his). Plus, what would the universe look like from its edge? What lies beyond our cosmic horizon, and could we ever see it? 

We explore the Silurian Hypothesis and whether a pre-human civilization might be forever lost under Earth’s shifting crust. If an intelligent species lived on Earth millions of years before us, would we even know? Chuck recalls a certain dinosaur sitcom, while Neil considers how crustal subduction buries geological records. What’s the timescale for Earth’s crust to recycle every trace of a lost civilization? Then it’s off to black holes: Is the singularity at the heart of a black hole real, or just a mathematical glitch?

From there, we shine light on why some materials are transparent and whether mining the Moon could affect Earth. We break down how light behaves at the atomic level—what makes some materials transparent while others blur or block? Would mining the Moon make it lighter? And if the Moon vanished, would tides survive? We debate renaming time itself, dream up wormholes in the kitchen, and figure out how massless photons still carry images. Finally, what if our whole universe is inside a black hole? Could each black hole house a universe of its own? Grab your space pants—this one’s a ride.

Are we becoming desensitized to this constant stream of bad news? And could that actually be necessary to help us stay functional amid global conflict and the climate crisis?

Are we growing emotionally numb to relentless negative headlines? Or is this emotional distance essential to keeping our survival instincts intact? 

The human organism is equipped to handle negative stimuli, explains neurophysiologist Ursula Koch. In Amsterdam, communication scientist Dominique Wirz studies how emotions are processed depending on the intensity and frequency of media consumption. Meanwhile, frontline workers at Doctors Without Borders often manage high-stress situations more effectively than passive "doomscrollers" overwhelmed by the news cycle.

How can we respond more constructively to distressing news? And why are members of the "Psychologists for Future” movement calling for strategies to help us cope with alarming climate reports?

In this documentary, filmmaker Sören Senn - a self-confessed bad news addict - investigates how his own media habits affect his mental state and explores how we might rethink the way we consume difficult news stories.

--

Bloodletting was a pervasive medical practice that dates as far back as ancient Greece and continued well into the 19th century. Physicians like Hippocrates believed bad health could be attributed to a fluid imbalance, and recommended bloodletting to help reset the body's balance. So, why did bloodletting stick around so long? Stephanie Honchell Smith digs into its popularity and shortcomings.

How did sauropods, uniquely large land animals, actually live, with their anatomy and physiology pushed to such extremes? Well, their unprecedented gigantism came with some equally massive costs…

However, unlike other programming languages, Python does not enforce type hints. You must use an external tool, such as Mypy, for that.In this tutorial, you will learn all about , a special way of adding type hinting to Heterogeneous dictionaries. A heterogeneous dictionary is a dictionary that has values that are not all the same type.But before you learn how to use the TypedDict, you should review how to type hint a regular dictionary.Type Hinting a Regular DictionaryA regular Python dictionary is defined as follows:my_dictionary = {"some_key": "some_value"}You can use any hashable type for the key, such as a string or an integer. The value of a dictionary can be any type whatsoever.When you want to type hint a dictionary, you would use the following: dict[key_type, value_type]Now let’s apply that to the example above:my_dictionary: dict[str, str] = {"some_key": "some_value"}If you are using a version of Python before 3.9, you will need to do the following instead:from typing import Dict

my_dictionary: Dict[str, str] = {"some_key": "some_value"}Fortunately, modern Python no longer requires that extra import.Now you’re ready to learn about how and why you might want to use the TypedDictThe TypedDict was introduced to Python in 3.8. You can read the full details about it in PEP 589. The reason you would use a TypedDict over a regular dictionary is when you have a dictionary with values of different types.my_dictionary = {"names": ["Mike", "Andrea", "John"],
                 "type": "employee",
                 "code": 123456
                }Type hinting this type of dictionary is more complex. You can do something like this, though:my_dictionary: dict[str, list | str | int] = {"names": ["Mike", "Andrea", "John"], "otype": "employee", "code": 123456 }Depending on how your type checker is configured, this might work. However, if you write code that modifies the list, your type checker may complain that a string doesn’t have an append method or vice versa.To make the type checker happier, you should use a .Here’s how you would use one with this example:from typing import TypedDict

class MultiTypeDict(TypedDict):
    names: list
    otype: str
    code: int

my_dictionary: MultiTypeDict = {"names": ["Mike", "Andrea", "John"], "otype": "employee", "code": 123456 }Isn’t that great? There’s just one problem. What if your dictionary’s keys have spaces in them? You cannot create class attributes with spaces!There’s a workaround for that. Check it out in the next section.Creating a TypedDict with Keys that Have SpacesFor this example, you will create a new dictionary with four keys, three of which contain spaces.To make a TypedDict for this type of dictionary, you need to call the TypedDict constructor instead of subclassing it:from typing import TypedDict

Results = TypedDict("Results",{"Animal Habitats": list,
                               "Tested": bool,
                               "Animal Name": str,
                               "Animal Location": str})

actual_results: Results = {
    "Animal Habitats": ["Asia", "N. America"],
    "Tested": False,
    "Animal Name": "Tigris",
    "Animal Location": "North Bay",
}When you call TypedDict, you pass in the typename (what you would have named the class) and the fields the dictionary should have. You’ll note that the fields are a dictionary. This is where you will put the keys that contain spaces and those without spaces.Give it a try and you’ll find it works great! is a handy tool for storing a complex dictionary. You will find that sometimes you even have these complex dictionaries inside of lists, tuples or even other dictionaries. Using the TypedDict can make type-hinting these data structures easier and prevent hard-to-detect defects from creeping in.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Are probiotics in yogurt a gimmick?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYj09lx15ik</link><author>Vox</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/sYj09lx15ik?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 13:01:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA">Vox</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ellen, please call me.

Vox reader Ellen sent in the question: Are probiotic yogurts a gimmick?  Aren’t all yogurts probiotic? Is calling it probiotic just a ploy to get you to pay more for yogurt?

Ellen didn’t leave a way to get in contact with her, but it’s a good question! So we thought we’d get to the bottom of it, on behalf of all Ellen’s who may have ever wondered this same thing.

In this video, we break down what probiotics actually are, whether they do what they claim, and how yogurt fits into the picture. Are all yogurts probiotic? Are probiotics even worth it? Or is it all just a marketing scam? 

To find out, I talked to a few experts, dug into the research, and ate more yogurt than I thought possible.

DESCRIPTION
Liz and Lesley explore the evolution of platform engineering from its DevOps and SRE roots. They discuss the challenges of building effective developer platforms, the importance of psychological safety and evidence-based prioritization, the complexities of open source sustainability, and the delicate balance between centralized platform teams and developer autonomy.

The conversation covers practical insights on documentation automation, onboarding strategies, the manager-engineer career pendulum, and why treating platform work as a service rather than a mandate is crucial for organizational success.

It isn't really a video game. It isn't part of a franchise. And most centrally, it isn't a free pack-in game.That last one feels instinctually unfair as a game reviewer who makes a point to ignore price in most cases. Games are worth what you're willing to pay for them, prices fluctuate, and I try to evaluate quality on its own merits. But Welcome Tour makes its price impossible to ignore because every bit of its identity feels so ideally crafted to be a pack-in game to introduce the Switch 2 to new users, and then it just ... isn't.The name is very pointed in this regard. This is built to be a primer for the Switch 2, explaining all of its new features in clear layman's terms. Informed Switch 2 players are bound to know what they're getting for their investment, but the non-gamers Nintendo likes to eye as part of its wide net "Blue Ocean" strategy may not understand the intricate alphabet soup of VRR and HDR. The in-game tutorials break down these complex topics with simple explanations that anyone can grasp, along with videos and demonstrations when necessary to let you experience the difference for yourself. It's genuinely neat! I could see handing this to my parents and having them walk away with, if not a complete understanding of next-gen gaming technology, at least a better grasp of it.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Vandals cut fiber-optic lines, causing outage for Spectrum Internet subscribers</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/vandals-cut-fiber-optic-lines-causing-outage-for-spectrum-internet-subscribers/</link><author>Dan Goodin</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/charter-spectrum-van-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 20:15:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Subscribers in Southern California of Spectrum’s Internet service experienced outages over the weekend following what company officials said was an attempted theft of copper lines located in Van Nuys, a suburb located 20 miles from downtown Los Angeles.The people behind the incident thought they were targeting copper lines, the officials wrote in a statement Sunday.

Today, they’re husband and wife.

Jenni and Julia were still in school when they fell in love in 2015. At first, they thought they were like any other gay couple. But Jenni felt increasingly uncomfortable in her own skin, until she decided to transition. She took hormones, her body changed, and she became who she is today – Jonathan. Today, the couple is in their late 20s, and happily married, as husband and wife. Together, they look back at the journey that lays behind them, and the adventures that still may come.

Get too close and the person driving will spot you; fall too far behind and you'll lose sight of the vehicle. It's the exact kind of mission structure we all decided was tired and needed to go away over a decade ago. The only difference in MindsEye is that you're piloting a drone instead of driving a car, so even the relatively small stakes are diminished by the fact that you can just fly really high to avoid being seen. It's not a positive first impression, especially when you factor in the confluence of concerning events surrounding the game and developer Build a Rocket Boy--from the studio's co-CEO stating that anyone sharing negative feedback about the game was being funded by an ubiquitous source, to the chief legal officer and CFO both leaving the company a few weeks before launch.Neither is a great look, yet I still went into MindsEye with an open mind. There's some pedigree behind the scenes, after all, with former Rockstar North lead Leslie Benzies handling directing duties. Benzies was a producer on Grand Theft Auto III through V before leaving to found Build a Rocket Boy, and you can clearly see elements of GTA's DNA in MindsEye. Unfortunately, the comparisons end there.MindsEye is not good. That early tailing mission is sadly indicative of the rest of the game as you slog through roughly 10 hours of dull and creatively bankrupt third-person action, combining driving and cover-based shooting within a linear framework. The story isn't completely terrible, at least, with a few entertaining moments sprinkled into what is otherwise a mostly forgettable tale. You play as Jacob Diaz, a former soldier with selective amnesia caused by a neural implant in his neck: the titular MindsEye. What initially begins as a personal quest to uncover his past gradually becomes a mission for humanity's survival, as familiar sci-fi tropes come to the fore.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why the Most Expensive Part of Epic’s Disney-Inspired HQ Are Private Offices | WSJ Open Office</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw27tlKcO7Q</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/cw27tlKcO7Q?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 14:00:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Epic Systems is the leading provider of electronic medical records in the U.S.—but its headquarters in Wisconsin looks nothing like a typical tech campus.

Stand by for more details, but for now, there is no urgency to back up private channels or direct messages.. Sometime later this year, our community may move to a new platform. If you are responsible for a channel or private channel, or a member of a User Group, you will need to take some actions as soon as you can.For the last decade, Slack has supported our project with a free customized enterprise account. They have let us know that they can no longer do so, particularly since our Slack is one of the largest and more active ones on the platform. As such, they will be downgrading it to a standard free Slack while we decide on, and implement, other options.On Friday, June 20, we will be subject to the feature limitations of free Slack. The primary ones which will affect us will be only retaining 90 days of history, and having to disable several apps and workflows which we are currently using. The Slack Admin team will do their best to manage these limitations.Responsible channel owners, members of private channels, and members of User Groups should take some actions to prepare for the upgrade and preserve information as soon as possible.The CNCF Projects Staff have proposed that our community look at migrating to Discord. Because of existing issues where we have been pushing the limits of Slack, they have already explored what a Kubernetes Discord would look like. Discord would allow us to implement new tools and integrations which would help the community, such as GitHub group membership synchronization.

But using another language, Apple recently "migrated its global Password Monitoring service from Java to Swift, achieving a 40% increase in throughput, and significantly reducing memory usage." 


This freed up nearly 50% of their previously allocated Kubernetes capacity, according to the article, and even "improved startup time, and simplified concurrency."


In a recent post, Apple engineers detailed how the rewrite helped the service scale to billions of requests per day while improving responsiveness and maintainability... "Swift allowed us to write smaller, less verbose, and more expressive codebases (close to 85% reduction in lines of code) that are highly readable while prioritizing safety and efficiency." 
Apple's Password Monitoring service, part of the broader Password app's ecosystem, is responsible for securely checking whether a user's saved credentials have appeared in known data breaches, without revealing any private information to Apple. It handles billions of requests daily, performing cryptographic comparisons using privacy-preserving protocols. This workload demands high computational throughput, tight latency bounds, and elastic scaling across regions... Apple's previous Java implementation struggled to meet the service's growing performance and scalability needs. Garbage collection caused unpredictable pause times under load, degrading latency consistency. Startup overhead — from JVM initialization, class loading, and just-in-time compilation, slowed the system's ability to scale in real time. Additionally, the service's memory footprint, often reaching tens of gigabytes per instance, reduced infrastructure efficiency and raised operational costs. 
Originally developed as a client-side language for Apple platforms, Swift has since expanded into server-side use cases.... Swift's deterministic memory management, based on reference counting rather than garbage collection (GC), eliminated latency spikes caused by GC pauses. This consistency proved critical for a low-latency system at scale. After tuning, Apple reported sub-millisecond 99.9th percentile latencies and a dramatic drop in memory usage: Swift instances consumed hundreds of megabytes, compared to tens of gigabytes with Java.
 

"While this isn't a sign that Java and similar languages are in decline," concludes InfoQ's article, "there is growing evidence that at the uppermost end of performance requirements, some are finding that general-purpose runtimes no longer suffice."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Standing up to the Right - Personal sacrifices for an open-minded society | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOUO1pIufBg</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/VOUO1pIufBg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jun 2025 16:00:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Right-wing radicals are becoming increasingly vocal in Germany. But many people oppose them and are fighting to defend democracy. Where do they find the courage to stand up to this sometimes-violent milieu?

Right-wing extremists are stronger than ever. In cities, the counter movement is strong and highly visible. But in more rural areas, anyone openly opposing the far right often has to reckon with threats and attempts at intimidation. A film team accompanied just some of the individuals whose resistance puts them at great personal risk.

Ocean Hale campaigns against the right in rural Saxony. In contrast to the demonstrations that take place in large cities such as Dresden and Leipzig, demonstrations in favor of a tolerant and diverse Germany are relatively small here. Most people either march openly on the opposite side or keep their political views to themselves. But Ocean isn’t afraid to show his face. He’s already organized two Christopher Street Days in the small town of Waldheim, and isn’t deterred by death threats and acid attacks.

Magdalena has launched the #ReclaimTikTok initiative. Together with others, she produces as much content as possible, all under the label: tolerant and anti-fascist. The campaign has already caught the attention of far-right activist Martin Sellner. Since her real name has been shared on various right-wing social media channels, Magdalena is also having to take greater care as she goes about her everyday life.

Jacob is an independent blogger and photographer in Gera, Thuringia. Whenever members of the Reichsbürger (Reich Citizens) movement gather from all over Germany for demonstrations in his hometown, he reports from crowd. Jacob thinks many people are irritated by these regular far-right rallies in Gera, but that they’re afraid to speak out. His aim: to document and inform, in order to increase public awareness.

Ocean, Magdalena, Jacob - they’re all taking personal risks and sacrificing their free time and anonymity to stand up for an open-minded society. What drives them? Where do they find their courage, when things get risky?

If a system allows a maximum of , any request beyond that limit within the same minute would either be  or , often with an HTTP  response.In this article, we will dive into the system design of a , and explore the the 5 most commonly used with examples, pros and cons.Before diving into the architecture, lets outline the functional and non-functional requirements:1.1 Functional RequirementsEnforce a fixed number of requests per user or API key within a defined time window (e.g., 100 requests per minute). Excess requests should be rejected with an HTTP .Limits must be enforced consistently across all nodes in a distributed environment. Users shouldn't bypass limits by switching servers.Apply limits across multiple time granularities simultaneously (e.g., per second, per minute, per hour) to prevent abuse over short and long bursts.1.2 Non-Functional RequirementsTo be usable at scale, our distributed rate-limiter must meet several critical non-functional goals:The system should scale horizontally to handle massive request volumes and growing user counts.Rate limit checks should be fast ideally adding no more than a few milliseconds per request.The rate-limiter should continue working  even under heavy load or node failures. There should be no single point of failure.All nodes should have a  of each user’s request counts. This prevents a client from bypassing limits by routing requests through different servers.The system should support a large number of operations per second and serve many concurrent clients without significant performance degradation.The  acts as a  between the client and the backend servers. Its job is to inspect incoming requests and enforce predefined usage limits (e.g., 100 requests per minute per user or IP).To apply these limits effectively, the rate limiter must  for each client. These counts are often maintained across , such as per second, per minute, or per hour.Using a traditional relational database for this purpose is generally unsuitable due to:: Relational databases involve disk I/O, which introduces delays on every read/write.: Handling thousands of concurrent updates (e.g., one per incoming request) can lead to locks and race conditions.: RDBMSs are not optimized for high-frequency, real-time counter updates. An  like  is a far better fit for rate limiting use cases because it offers: for both reads and writes like , , and , ensuring safe concurrent updates without race conditionsTTL (Time-to-Live) support, allowing counters to reset automatically at the end of each time window (e.g., after 60 seconds for a per-minute limit)Here’s how the rate limiter fits into the flow of an incoming request: to an endpoint of the application.The  performs several checks:Identifies the client (via IP, token, or API key)Looks up the current request count in Redis (or in-memory cache)Applies any  (e.g., free vs premium users)If the count exceeds the allowed threshold, the request is  with HTTP 429 Too Many Requests.If the count is , the counter is incremented and the request proceeds to the backend service.Periodically,  via TTL or are reset based on window granularity.Many modern applications delegate rate limiting to  such as  or , which can efficiently enforce limits before traffic reaches backend services. However, for this discussion, we will focus on designing a  that is integrated into or called by  directly.3.1 Single-Node Rate LimitingFor small-scale applications with low traffic and a single application server, rate limiting can be implemented entirely , without relying on external systems like Redis. This approach is lightweight, fast, and easy to set up.You maintain a simple  in the application process where: represent client identifiers (e.g., user ID, API key, or IP address) represent request counts within the current time windowFor each incoming request:Checks if the user exists in the mapIf not, create a new entry with a count of 1If the user exists, increments their counterCompare the count against the defined rate limitIf the count is within the limit, allow the request; otherwise, reject itYou can also add a time-based mechanism (e.g., timestamps or TTL logic) to reset counters after each time window.Despite its simplicity, this approach comes with  that make it unsuitable for production environments at scale:Single Point of Failure (SPOF): If the server crashes, all in-memory counters are lost. After a restart, the system "forgets" users' recent request history potentially allowing them to exceed their limits until the counters rebuild.No Horizontal Scalability: The rate limiter lives on a so it doesn’t scale with traffic.Without proper eviction or TTL logic, memory usage can grow unbounded over time, especially if you're tracking many users or long-duration windows.Now, lets explore two common strategies to implement rate limiting in a distributed environment.3.2 Distributed Rate Limiting]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Do You Move A 200kg Dinosaur Fossil? | Walking with Dinosaurs | BBC Earth Science</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_8hZxxl5e4</link><author>BBC Earth Science</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/T_8hZxxl5e4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jun 2025 13:01:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdsOTr6SmDrxuWE7sJFrkhQ">BBC Earth Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hunting for dinosaur bones is the highlight of most palaeontologists' careers, but what happens after they find them?

But is that still true? 

Python's original creator Guido van Rossum addressed the question last month in a lightning talk at the annual Python Language Summit 2025.

Guido started by recounting earlier periods of Python development from 35 years ago, where he used UNIX "almost exclusively" and thus "Python was greatly influenced by UNIX's 'worse is better' philosophy"... "The fact that [Python] wasn't perfect encouraged many people to start contributing. All of the code was straightforward, there were no thoughts of optimization... These early contributors also now had a stake in the language; [Python] was also their baby"... 

Guido contrasted early development to how Python is developed now: "features that take years to produce from teams of software developers paid by big tech companies. The static type system requires an academic-level understanding of esoteric type system features." And this isn't just Python the language, "third-party projects like numpy are maintained by folks who are paid full-time to do so.... Now we have a huge community, but very few people, relatively speaking, are contributing meaningfully." 
Guido asked whether the expectation for Python contributors going forward would be that "you had to write a perfect PEP or create a perfect prototype that can be turned into production-ready code?" Guido pined for the "old days" where feature development could skip performance or feature-completion to get something into the hands of the community to "start kicking the tires". "Do we have to abandon 'worse is better' as a philosophy and try to make everything as perfect as possible?" Guido thought doing so "would be a shame", but that he "wasn't sure how to change it", acknowledging that core developers wouldn't want to create features and then break users with future releases. 
Guido referenced David Hewitt's PyO3 talk about Rust and Python, and that development "was using worse is better," where there is a core feature set that works, and plenty of work to be done and open questions. "That sounds a lot more fun than working on core CPython", Guido paused, "...not that I'd ever personally learn Rust. Maybe I should give it a try after," which garnered laughter from core developers. 

"Maybe we should do more of that: allowing contributors in the community to have a stake and care".]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Iran’s Military Capabilities Against Israel, Explained | WSJ</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/XT4ntnutmJY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jun 2025 01:22:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As Iran strikes back at Israel after an unprecedented attack on Tehran’s nuclear operations, WSJ explains Iran’s military capabilities and strategy.

RHEL Adds an AI Assistant</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/06/14/1947215/rocky-and-alma-linux-still-going-strong-rhel-adds-an-ai-assistant?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jun 2025 19:49:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Rocky Linux 10 "Red Quartz" has reached general availability, notes a new article in The Register — surveying the differences between "RHELatives" — the major alternatives to Red Hat Enterprise Linux:

The Rocky 10 release notes describe what's new, such as support for RISC-V computers. Balancing that, this version only supports the Raspberry Pi 4 and 5 series; it drops Rocky 9.x's support for the older Pi 3 and Pi Zero models... 

RHEL 10 itself, and Rocky with it, now require x86-64-v3, meaning Intel "Haswell" generation kit from about 2013 onward. Uniquely among the RHELatives, AlmaLinux offers a separate build of version 10 for x86-64-v2 as well, meaning Intel "Nehalem" and later — chips from roughly 2008 onward. AlmaLinux has a history of still supporting hardware that's been dropped from RHEL and Rocky, which it's been doing since AlmaLinux 9.4. Now that includes CPUs. In comparison, the system requirements for Rocky Linux 10 are the same as for RHEL 10. The release notes say.... "The most significant change in Rocky Linux 10 is the removal of support for x86-64-v2 architectures. AMD and Intel 64-bit architectures for x86-64-v3 are now required." 

A significant element of the advertising around RHEL 10 involves how it has an AI assistant. This is called Red Hat Enterprise Linux Lightspeed, and you can use it right from a shell prompt, as the documentation describes... It's much easier than searching man pages, especially if you don't know what to look for... [N]either AlmaLinux 10 nor Rocky Linux 10 includes the option of a helper bot. No big surprise there...
[Rocky Linux] is sticking closest to upstream, thanks to a clever loophole to obtain source RPMs. Its hardware requirements also closely parallel RHEL 10, and CIQ is working on certifications, compliance, and special editions. Meanwhile, AlmaLinux is maintaining support for older hardware and CPUs, which will widen its appeal, and working with partners to ensure reboot-free updates and patching, rather than CIQ's keep-it-in-house approach. All are valid, and all three still look and work almost identically... except for the LLM bot assistant.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Exploring The Mystery Of The Black Hole | Universe | BBC Earth Science</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zxCgpOD8Tg</link><author>BBC Earth Science</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/2zxCgpOD8Tg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jun 2025 15:00:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdsOTr6SmDrxuWE7sJFrkhQ">BBC Earth Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[What happens when gravitational forces become overwhelmingly strong?

ABSTRACT
As programmers, we tend to treat data as generic stuff to feed into the #algorithms and #architectures we love. We don’t really pay attention to the data itself, especially when we have terabytes or petabytes of it.

Huge mistake. And we are trained to make it! It is why it takes a year for a new programmer to be productive at working on the #GoogleRanking algorithm. It held back progress on genome #SequencingAlgorithms. It has cost me more time than I’d care to imagine.

The good news is that you don’t have to look at all of your petabytes of data. Just eyeball a ten record sample when you start, and repeat as you work the data. Even then, eyeballing can be hard work, and done wrong can be worse than doing nothing. But done right, it can be fun, and the data will almost always surprise you. Better yet, you can use your favorite algorithms and architectures to build tools to make eyeballing your data easier and much more effective.

Jisc, a membership organization that runs procurement for higher and further education establishments in the UK, said it had signed an agreement to purchase the new subscription licenses after consultation with members. In a procurement notice, it said institutions that use Oracle Java SE are required to purchase subscriptions. "The agreement includes the waiver of historic fees due for any institutions who have used Oracle Java since 2023," the notice said.
 
The Java SE Universal Subscription was introduced in January 2023 to an outcry from licensing experts and analysts. It moved licensing of Java from a per-user basis to a per-employee basis. At the time, Oracle said it was "a simple, low-cost monthly subscription that includes Java SE Licensing and Support for use on Desktops, Servers or Cloud deployments." However, licensing advisors said early calculations to help some clients showed that the revamp might increase costs by up to ten times. Later, analysis from Gartner found the per-employee subscription model to be two to five times more expensive than the legacy model.
 
"For large organizations, we expect the increase to be two to five times, depending on the number of employees an organization has," Nitish Tyagi, principal Gartner analyst, said in July 2024. "Please remember, Oracle defines employees as part-time, full-time, temporary, agents, contractors, as in whosoever supports internal business operations has to be licensed as per the new Java Universal SE Subscription model." Since the introduction of the new Oracle Java licensing model, user organizations have been strongly advised to move off Oracle Java and find open source alternatives for their software development and runtime environments. A survey of Oracle users found that only one in ten was likely to continue to stay with Oracle Java, in part as a result of the licensing changes.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The military is getting political #shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/FTA8txZ3id0</link><author>Vox</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/FTA8txZ3id0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 19:46:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA">Vox</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A very big, very beautiful military parade is happening on Trump’s birthday.

The Alters is a continuation of this pattern, melding a straightforward survival game with management systems designed around making tough calls. But this time, it's not other people who will face the consequences of your decisions. Instead, The Alters forces you to confront other versions of yourself as you grapple with staying alive and keeping a small population of your clones happy. It's an intriguing premise that delivers on the studio's signature style, even if some of its survival systems occasionally get in the way.You play as Jan Dolski, who wakes up on the shores of a black beach on a planet very far from home. The surroundings are dark and oppressive, with the stark red plumes of smoke from flares and cracking lightning above illuminating your way toward your only refuge; a monolithic wheel with a base suspended inside it. You are alone, and getting back home is going to require gathering a lot of resources. You do this by discovering resource deposits in the area around you, erecting a network of pylons as you explore further and further away from safety, and using it to ferry resources back.You need a steady supply of metals, minerals, and organics to build better tools, construct additions to your base, and produce food in order to survive. The planet might be foreign, but it has what you need to get home. The only thing that isn't in abundance is time. As the days tick by, the sunrise creeps closer, spelling doom to anyone caught in its highly radioactive rays.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Jackson Pollock Part One: The Myth of the Modern Artist</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sQ_cfZ8q9k</link><author>Great Art Explained</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/0sQ_cfZ8q9k?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 17:01:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCePDFpCr78_qmVtpoB1Axaw">Great Art Explained</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Try Opera browser FOR FREE here: https://opr.as/Opera-air-greatartexplained

In 1949, Life magazine asked: “Is Jackson Pollock, the greatest American Painter. He is a figure that is polarising among art aficionados. Some see him as a fraud, others as a genius.

In Part One of my film I look at how, post World War Two, the art scene shifted from Paris to New York. How America was searching for "The Great American painter", and why he is so loved and hated at the same time. I look at just what Abstract Expressionism means, how we can "read it", and I look at the myths surrounding Pollock and modern art itself. I also look at his influences ranging from Mexican sand Painting, to the Regionalist art movement, to Picasso and the modernists.

What could survive an impact so massive it should have shattered the entire world into pieces? Saturn's scarred survivor Tethys holds dark secrets - a massive crater that spans half its diameter, a colossal trench wrapping around its body, and a bizarre thermal anomaly that looks just like Pac-Man.  In this video, we uncover the shocking secrets frozen in Tethys' icy shell and discover how this scarred world became one of the solar system's most remarkable survivors.

You will find references at the bottom of this page if you want to go deeper.Once upon a time, there lived a junior software engineer named Asahi.He worked for a tech company named Hooli.Although smart, he never received the opportunity to work on any interesting project.So he was sad and frustrated.Until one day, when he had the idea of applying for a new job.And the interviewer asked him 1 simple question,“Can you list 5 popular cache strategies?”.Yet he failed to answer it, and the interview was over in 7 minutes.So he studied it later to fill the knowledge gap.Outlier is hiring experienced developers to help train cutting-edge AI models with expert human feedback. Work flexibly from anywhere, get paid weekly (up to $50/hr), and apply your real-world dev skills to real AI challenges—no AI experience required.He failed the interview, so you don’t have to.And here’s how you can answer it:A  is used to store frequently accessed data, thus serving future requests faster. Also it keeps data in memory for low latency. Yet the available memory is limited. So frequent updates to the cache are necessary.The technique of storing, retrieving, and managing data in a cache for performance and optimal memory usage is called a .The cache aside is one of the most popular cache strategies. It’s also called  because data gets cached only when it’s queried.The app tries to read data from the cacheIt then reads data from the database on a cache missThe data gets written to the cacheA  means the queried data is unavailable in the cache.Besides the cache doesn't interact with the database directly; instead, the app does.This strategy is easy to implement. But there’s a risk of data inconsistency and extra latency because of network round trips.It’s used in read-heavy workloads, such as configuration data or user profiles.Ready for the next technique?2. Write Through StrategyThe write-through cache strategy ensures strong consistency between the cache and the database.The app writes to the cacheThe cache thenwritesto the database The app doesn't interact with the database directly; instead, the cache does.Although this strategy offers data consistency, the latency on writes is higher. Also the cache space might get wasted with infrequently accessed data.It’s used where write rate is low, and when data freshness is critical.The read-through cache strategy installs the cache between the app and the database. This means all reads go through the cache.The app reads data from the cacheThen it reads data from the database on a cache missThe data gets written to the cache and then returned to the appThe app doesn't interact with the database directly; instead, the cache does.Although this strategy offers low latency, there’s a risk of data inconsistency.It’s used in read-heavy workloads, such as a newsfeed or a product catalog.The write-back strategy writes data to the cache for batching and performance. This means write latency is low.The app writes to the cache directlyThe cache then writes datato the database This strategy offers better write performance through batching. Yet there’s a risk of data loss if the cache fails before writing to the database.It’s used in write-heavy workloads where throughput is more important than durability.Here’s how the write-around cache strategy works:The app writes to the databaseIt tries to read data from the cache laterThe app reads from the database on a cache missIt then updates the cacheAlthough this strategy optimizes cache storage for frequently accessed data, there is a risk of increased latency because of cache misses.It’s used for large data objects where updates happen rarely.The 2 popular cache implementations are Redis and Memcached.Read heavy workload: use cache aside or read through strategiesConsistency vs throughput: use write-through or write-back strategiesAvoid caching one-off writes: use write-around strategyIt’s important to pick the right cache strategy based on your needs and tradeoffs.Subscribe to get simplified case studies delivered straight to your inbox:Want to advertise in this newsletter? 📰Thank you for supporting this newsletter.

Compiling evidence from both historic sources and new technologies point to the correct location in this seismic, revelatory new film. In this startling and original documentary, writer and historian, Dan Gibson, shows that descriptions of Muhammad's original holy city – as detailed in the Qur’an and Islamic histories, do not match that of the Mecca we know today. If true this could shake Islam to its roots, because every Muslim is required to pray towards the ‘forbidden gathering place’.

It aims to solve one of the biggest shortcomings of passkeys as they have existed to date. Passkeys created on one operating system or credential manager are largely bound to those environments. A passkey created on a Mac, for instance, can sync easily enough with other Apple devices connected to the same iCloud account. Transferring them to a Windows device or even a dedicated credential manager installed on the same Apple device has been impossible.That limitation has led to criticisms that passkeys are a power play by large companies to lock users into specific product ecosystems. Users have also rightly worried that the lack of transferability increases the risk of getting locked out of important accounts if a device storing passkeys is lost, stolen, or destroyed.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Crisis In Physics: Are We Missing 17 Layers of Reality?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cY6Y4lE3LTo</link><author>PBS Space Time</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/cY6Y4lE3LTo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 20:15:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_gcs09iThXybpVgjHZ_7g">PBS Space Time</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Remove your personal information from the web at https://joindeleteme.com/SPACETIME

Big things are made of smaller things, and those smaller things are made of smaller things still. That’s reductionism in a nutshell, and digging our way to the smallest layer has been one of the primary goals of physics for ever. But what if, just before we reach the bottom, we find out that reductionism fails?

Thanks to our sponsor, T-Mobile: http://t-mobile.com/FirstResponders

Over the past 20 years, nearly 200 rural hospitals have closed, and experts warn that another 700 are at risk of closure in the near future. To put that in context, Texas alone has seen 25 hospital closures since 2005. If nothing is done, the state could lose over half the remaining small town hospitals. That means people are driving further for care, sometimes over an hour, or waiting longer to get help. These delays could lead to worse health outcomes. 

Nationwide, an estimated 20% of the US population lives in rural areas. Other estimates found that 80% of counties across the US lack adequate access to health care. Unlike their urban counterparts, small town hospitals are often the entire health care system for the community, meaning they provide a wide range of services from lab tests and screening to basic primary care. When one shuts down, it means the surrounding community could lose access to all health care. There is bipartisan support to assist rural communities, and Congress has passed a number of bills over the decades to try to keep these facilities open, but it still isn’t enough. So why are so many rural hospitals shutting down?

It’s a multifaceted issue that comes back again and again to income. At its core, a hospital is a business and, often, not a very lucrative one. One recent report found that over 50% of rural hospitals are operating at a deficit. The slightest change in income could be the difference between staying open and having to shut their doors for good. Watch the piece above to learn more.

This piece is a small bite of a huge topic. Check out other pieces from Vox.com’s Dylan Scott to learn more about the challenges rural hospitals face:

Believe it or not, an early review came in from the brilliant Stephen Fry (yikes!): 
"James Payne’s YouTube Channel “Great Art Explained” gained a huge and appreciative worldwide audience. This beautifully put-together book is simply the best introduction to the lifelong pleasure and rewards of looking at pictures since Gombrich. An instant classic". 

Great Art Explained unveils the fascinating stories behind some of the world’s most iconic paintings and sculptures, proving that there’s more to art than just watching paint dry. 
It can be thrilling, and resonate on a deep personal level. It is how you view the work, place it in context and understand its history that makes an artwork truly come alive.
A fresh approach to a classic subject, James Payne’s no-nonsense analysis sheds new light on 30 masterpieces from around the globe and reveals what makes them truly timeless works of art.
Each chapter delves into not only the art itself but also the artist’s life, as well as the work’s place in their wider oeuvre; in other words, what makes it ‘great’.

--

In the 1800s, minister Sylvester Graham believed Americans had a big problem— not just with their bodies, but their souls. He argued that overindulgence was fueling their baser desires, making them immoral and oversexed. To curb this corruption, puritanical reformers advocated for foods they thought curbed a variety of appetites. Stephanie Honchell Smith details the invention of Graham crackers.

In the States, you probably haven't heard that phrase, but in the European Union, digital sovereignty is a big deal and getting bigger.
 
A combination of security, economic, political, and societal imperatives is driving the EU's digital sovereignty moves. EU leaders are seeking to reduce Europe's dependence on foreign technology providers, primarily those from the United States, and to assert greater control over its digital infrastructure, data, and technological future. Why? Because they're concerned about who controls European data, who sets the rules, and who can potentially cut off access to essential services in times of geopolitical tension. "Money issues have also played a decisive role," writes ZDNet's Steven Vaughan-Nichols. "Copenhagen's Microsoft software bill has soared from 313 million kroner in 2018 to 538 million kroner -- about $53 million in 2023, a 72% increase in just five years.
 
David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH), a Dane, inventor of Ruby on Rails, and co-owner of the software developer company 37Signals, has said: "Denmark is one of the most highly digitalized countries in the world. It's also one of the most Microsoft-dependent. In fact, Microsoft is by far and away the single biggest dependency, so it makes perfect sense to start the quest for digital sovereignty there."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The end of the Wermacht</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/uio2PYf6ofw</link><author>Imperial War Museums</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/uio2PYf6ofw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 11:01:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3uAjWoLZ4bSi6qI9SjALxA">Imperial War Museums</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Introducing the search feature</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4JLtJDSTJw</link><author>probabl</author><category>dev</category><category>ml</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/-4JLtJDSTJw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 09:25:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIat2Cdg661wF5DQDWTQAmg">Dev - Probabl</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[skore v0.9.1 is out!

Unlike Docker or Podman, this tool is designed to feel at home in the Apple ecosystem and hooks into frameworks already built into the operating system. Container runs standard OCI images, but it doesn't use a single shared Linux VM. Instead, it creates a small Linux virtual machine for every container you spin up. That sounds heavy at first, but the VMs are lightweight and boot quickly. Each one is isolated, which Apple claims improves both security and privacy. Developers can run containerized workloads locally with native macOS support and without needing to install third-party container platforms.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hollywood studios target AI image generator in copyright lawsuit</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/in-landmark-suit-disney-and-universal-sue-midjourney-for-ai-character-theft/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/disney_statue-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 18:58:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On Wednesday, Disney and  filed a lawsuit against AI image-synthesis company Midjourney, accusing the company of copyright infringement for allowing users to create images of characters like Darth Vader and Shrek, reports The Hollywood Reporter.

The company also reduced API pricing for o3-pro by 87 percent compared to o1-pro while cutting o3 prices by 80 percent. While "reasoning" is useful for some analytical tasks, new studies have posed fundamental questions about what the word actually means when applied to these AI systems.We'll take a deeper look at "reasoning" in a minute, but first, let's examine what's new. While OpenAI originally launched o3 (non-pro) in April, the o3-pro model focuses on mathematics, science, and coding while adding new capabilities like web search, file analysis, image analysis, and Python execution. Since these tool integrations slow response times (longer than the already slow o1-pro), OpenAI recommends using the model for complex problems where accuracy matters more than speed. However, they do not necessarily confabulate less than "non-reasoning" AI models (they still introduce factual errors), which is a significant caveat when seeking accurate results.Beyond the reported performance improvements, OpenAI announced a substantial price reduction for developers. O3-pro costs $20 per million input tokens and $80 per million output tokens in the API, making it 87 percent cheaper than o1-pro. The company also reduced the price of the standard o3 model by 80 percent.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Roc programming language (Interview)</title><link>https://changelog.com/podcast/645</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/podcast/645/the-changelog-645.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 16:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Jerod chats with Richard Feldman about Roc – his fast, friendly, functional language inspired by Richard’s love of Elm.

As the Senate decides on Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Budget, a lesser-known provision tucked into the House-approved bill has drawn attention from Wall Street.

The measure, known as Section 899, would allow the U.S. to add a new tax of up to 20% on foreigners with U.S. investments, including multinational companies operating in the U.S.

Some analysts call the provision a “revenge tax” due to its wording. It would apply to foreign entities if their home country imposes “unfair foreign taxes” against U.S. companies, according to the bill.

This journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate​.

Six months after the fall of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria, more than 100,000 of the 1 million people detained by Assad’s regime during the Syrian war are still unaccounted for. What is known about the brutal system of detention, torture and killing under which they disappeared?

“Syria’s Detainee Files” documents the search for answers and accountability, shedding new light on atrocities under Assad through stunning testimony of former regime insiders and officers who carried them out, alongside the accounts of people who survived them.

The documentary follows Shadi and Hadi Haroun, two brothers who survived torture and almost a decade of imprisonment. Shadi says, “I lost 10 years of my life because of someone’s decision. Simply, ‘Erase ten years of his life, from the smallest moments to the most important ones.’”

The film explores how many former officials — some of whom defected, and some of whom stayed loyal to the regime until the end — rationalize their actions, saying they were following the orders of a government that would have killed them otherwise.

Now that the Assad regime has fallen and there are calls for accountability, the film raises questions about who, in a vast system of people following orders, should be held responsible for the atrocities.

“Syria’s Detainee Files” is a BBC Current Affairs production for GBH/FRONTLINE and BBC. The producers are Amel Guettatfi, Saad Al Nassife and Sara Obeidat. The directors are Sasha Joelle Achilli and Sara Obeidat. The senior producer is Dan Edge. The editor-in-chief and executive producer of FRONTLINE is Raney Aronson-Rath.

Microsoft is taking action to block one exploit and allowing the other one to remain a viable threat.As part of Tuesday's monthly security update routine, Microsoft patched CVE-2025-3052, a Secure Boot bypass vulnerability affecting more than 50 device makers. More than a dozen modules that allow devices from these manufacturers to run on Linux allow an attacker with physical access to turn off Secure Boot and, from there, go on to install malware that runs before the operating system loads. Such “evil maid” attacks are precisely the threat Secure Boot is designed to prevent. The vulnerability can also be exploited remotely to make infections stealthier and more powerful if an attacker has already gained administrative control of a machine.A single point of failureThe underlying cause of the vulnerability is a critical vulnerability in a tool used to flash firmware images on the motherboards of devices sold by DT Research, a manufacturer of rugged mobile devices.

Yes, arcade racers like Forza Horizon have travelled across the world, from Australia to Mexico and everything in between, but have yet to visit the bustling streets of Tokyo or the rich countryside across Kyoto. That series also doesn't dabble in the kind of street-racing culture popularised by games like Need for Speed or films such as the earlier Fast and the Furious entries, sticking closely to flashy but strictly stock configurations of popular cars. With that said, it's easy to see the gap JDM: Japanese Drift Master is trying to fill, carving out its own niche with a driving model heavily tuned towards challenging and satisfying drifting, set against a condensed and well-realised slice of Japan. It's such a shame then that the sum of all of its disparate parts don't come together in a cohesive way.Drifting is primarily what Japanese Drift Master is all about, and it's easily the strongest aspect of the game. Whipping a rear-wheel-drive, torque-filled machine into a controlled slide is simple, but it's maintaining a good angle and adequate speed that make it engaging. A balance meter, similar to one you'd find during a grind in Tony Hawk Pro Skater, helps you gauge the angle of your drift and deftly balance it, steering into the direction the back of your car is facing while gently applying the accelerator to power through the slide. It feels good to figure out how to expertly control a drift, and even better when you can use the handbrake to quickly change angles or drop the clutch to provide a little more torque through a corner.Drift events let you showcase your understanding of Japanese Drift Master's driving model the best, but they're also some of the easiest events the game has to offer. Racking up a high enough score to pass was rarely an issue for me in most events, but also came down to some frustrating luck in some instances. The longer and more aggressively you drift, the higher your score multiplier climbs, resetting if you spin out or suffer a collision. The issue isn't that this happens at all, but rather how inconsistently it does. Japanese Drift Master feels overly punishing with the angle at which it judges a spin, sometimes resetting your score unfairly if you enter a drift at an angle it isn't anticipating. Similarly, it isn't clear which collisions reset your multiplier and which don't. I had instances where I hit road barriers hard without seeing my score disappear, and others where the lightest touch by traffic would end a particularly long one. Without being able to depend on knowing the limitations of what I could get away with in a drift, it became frustrating trying to find the absolute limit that I could push myself without wasting time in the process.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2335 - Dr. Mary Talley Bowden</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Ru7BIqXQZns?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 17:00:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Dr. Mary Talley Bowden is a board-certified Otolaryngologist, Sleep Medicine specialist, and founder of BreatheMD: a direct-care ENT practice in Houston, Texas.

Why three dimensions? Neil deGrasse Tyson and comedians Chuck Nice and Hasan Minhaj celebrate 100 years of quantum physics and everywhere it’s taken us, joined by theoretical astrophysicists Brian Greene and Janna Levin live at the Beacon Theater.

We begin in the 1920s with the famous Shapley-Curtis debate: were spiral nebulae entire galaxies or just “space lint”? We discuss how Edwin Hubble spotted Cepheid variables and shattered the idea that the Milky Way was the entire universe. Discover how Henrietta Leavitt's data, Georges Lemaître’s math, and Einstein’s “cosmological constant” all collided in a revolutionary era that gave birth to expansion.

As the universe expanded, so did our questions. Was there a beginning? What happened at time zero? The Big Bang theory emerged, colliding with the idea that the universe is in a steady state, and intrigued members of the clergy. What is quantum mechanics really telling us about reality? Why did the idea of a beginning disturb scientists? And how do wave functions, tunneling, and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle reshape reality?

Plus: Why do we think the universe has three dimensions? Could dark energy be spillover from other dimensions? And how do relativity and quantum mechanics still refuse to play nice? Chuck blows a gasket, and so does Brian on this special live taping of StarTalk.

Elsewhere on the site, a Computer Science and AI Foundations curriculum is described that includes units on 'Foundations of AI Programming [in Python]' and 'Insights from Data and AI [aka Data Science].' A more-detailed AI Foundations Syllabus 25-26 document promises a second semester of material is coming soon: "This semester offers an innovative approach to teaching programming by integrating learning with and about artificial intelligence (AI). Using Python as the primary language, students build foundational programming skills while leveraging AI tools to enhance computational thinking and problem-solving. The curriculum also introduces students to the basics of creating AI-powered programs, exploring machine learning, and applying data science principles."
 
Newly-posted videos on Code.org's YouTube channel appear to be intended to support the new Python-based CS & AI course. "Python is extremely versatile," explains a Walmart data scientist to open the video for Data Science: Using Python. "So, first of all, Python is one of the very few languages that can handle numbers very, very well." A researcher at the Univ. of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) adds, "Python is the gold standard and what people expect data scientists to know [...] Key to us being able to handle really big data sets is our use of Python and cluster computing." Adding to the Python love, an IHME data analyst explains, "Python is a great choice for large databases because there's a lot of support for Python libraries."
 
Code.org is currently recruiting teachers to attend its CS and AI Foundations Professional Learning program this summer, which is being taught by Code.org's national network of university and nonprofit regional partners (teachers who signup have a chance to win $250 in DonorsChoose credits for their classrooms). A flyer for a five-day Michigan Professional Development program to prepare teachers for a pilot of the Code.org CS & A course touts the new curriculum as "an alternative to the AP [Computer Science] pathway" (teachers are offered scholarships covering registration, lodging, meals, and workshop materials).
 
Interestingly, Code.org's embrace of Python and Data Science comes as the nonprofit changes its mission to 'make CS and AI a core part of K-12 education' and launches a new national campaign with tech leaders to make CS and AI a graduation requirement. Prior to AI changing the education conversation, Code.org in 2021 boasted that it had lined up a consortium of tech giants, politicians, and educators to push its new $15 million Amazon-bankrolled Java AP CS A curriculum into K-12 classrooms. Just three years later, however, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy was boasting to investors that Amazon had turned to AI to automatically do Java coding that he claimed would have otherwise taken human coders 4,500 developer-years to complete.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The V2 Rocket was POINTLESS, and here&apos;s why</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/YNdYXPOnBDY</link><author>Imperial War Museums</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/YNdYXPOnBDY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 11:01:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3uAjWoLZ4bSi6qI9SjALxA">Imperial War Museums</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Challenge of AI Model Evaluations with Ankur Goyal</title><link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/06/10/the-challenge-of-ai-model-evaluations-with-ankur-goyal/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=the-challenge-of-ai-model-evaluations-with-ankur-goyal</link><author>SEDaily</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://traffic.megaphone.fm/SED2687110252.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 09:00:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/podcast/">Podcast - Software Engineering Daily</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Evaluations are critical for assessing the quality, performance, and effectiveness of software during development.

It stores user claims directly inside the token, which remains on the client. The server only needs to verify the  to authenticate the user, without storing any session data.This makes them a great choice for building scalable APIs that do not depend on shared memory or server-side sessions.In this article, we'll cover:What a JWT token looks like?Security considerations and best practices is offering flexible, remote freelance opportunities for frontend developers to help shape the future of AI—no prior AI experience required.Whether you specialize in React, Next.js, or modern UI/UX design, Outlier’s projects let you apply your coding skills to review, evaluate, and improve AI-generated code while earning plus bonuses, with .💰 : Up to $30/hr (USD) based on expertise & location🌎 : No contracts, fully remote, choose your own hours🧠 : Collaborate on next-gen AI workflows🎯 : No AI background needed—just strong HTML, CSS, JS, React/VueA  is a compact, URL-safe token used to securely transmit information between two parties, typically a client and a server. It is digitally signed, ensuring the data inside hasn’t been tampered with and can be trusted. It’s like a  that proves who you are.JWTs are widely used in modern web and mobile applications, especially for  and . Here's why they're so popular:Stateless Authentication: With JWTs, all the necessary user information (like user ID, role, and expiration time) is stored .Because JWTs are , they can be easily used in distributed systems and microservices without the need to share session state across servers.JWTs are signed (and optionally encrypted), ensuring that the data hasn’t been tampered with and can be trusted.JWTs support , which means you can store any data your application needs such as roles, permissions, or tenant IDs. Verifying a signature (especially HMAC) can be faster than making a database call to look up session information.Cross-Domain Communication (CORS): Since JWTs are typically sent in an HTTP header, they work well across different domains, unlike cookies which have stricter domain policies.A JSON Web Token (JWT) is made up of , separated by dots:Each part serves a specific purpose. Let’s break it down.The header contains metadata about the token.It usually looks like this:{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}: The algorithm used to sign the token (e.g., HS256 for HMAC, RS256 for RSA).: The token type, always set to "JWT".This JSON is then  to form the  of the token.The payload contains the , information about the user or system. Claims are just pieces of data.There are three types of claims:A set of predefined and commonly used claims. Not required, but recommended.: Issuer (who issued the token): Subject (who the token refers to, often the user ID): Audience (who the token is intended for): Expiration time (when the token expires): Not before (token becomes valid after this time): Issued at (when the token was created): Token ID (unique identifier to prevent reuse)These are custom claims that are shared publicly. Should be unique to avoid conflicts, ideally defined in a public namespace.These are custom claims created to share information between parties that agree on using them. They are neither registered nor public claims. (e.g., userId, username, roles, permissions).{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "admin": true,
  "iat": 1516239022,
  "exp": 1516242622 // Expires in 1 hour
}This JSON is also  to form the  of the token.The payload is encoded, not encrypted. Anyone can decode it, so never put sensitive information like passwords inside.This is the security part. It's used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and to ensure that the message wasn't changed along the way.Sign the resulting string using the algorithm mentioned in the header () and a secret or private keyExample using HMAC SHA-256:HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." + base64UrlEncode(payload),
  secret
)The result is  and forms the  of the token.Here’s a step-by-step look at how authentication typically works using JWTs:The user initiates a login by sending a POST request with their email and password or social login token:POST /login
{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "password": "mypassword"
}Step 2: Server Verifies Credentials & Generates JWTIf the credentials are valid, the authentication server generates a JWT:const token = jwt.sign(
  { userId: 123, role: 'admin' },
  SECRET_KEY,
  { expiresIn: '1h' }
);The token payload includes user-specific claims, such as user ID and role.The token also contains an expiration time ().The header and payload are signed using a secret key (for HS256) or a private key (for RS256).The server sends the generated JWT back to the client, typically in the response body.{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR..."
}Step 3: Client Stores JWTThe client securely stores the token for use in future requests. Common storage options include::  or  (though these are vulnerable to XSS attacks), or preferably an  (which cannot be accessed via JavaScript).: Platform-specific secure storage solutions, such as Keychain on iOS or Keystore on Android.Step 4: Client Sends JWT with Each RequestFor every subsequent API call, the client includes the JWT in the  header using the Bearer schema:GET /dashboard
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>This allows the server to identify and authenticate the user without storing session state.Step 5: Server Verifies Signature and Grants AccessExtracts the token from the  headerVerifies the token’s signature and checks for expirationIf the token is valid, the user is authenticated and the server processes the request.If the token is invalid or expired, the server responds with an appropriate error, such as:401 Unauthorized
403 ForbiddenWhile JWTs are powerful, incorrect implementation can lead to serious vulnerabilities.Here’s how to use them securely:Transmit JWTs only over HTTPS to prevent them from being intercepted in transit.Keep Secrets/Private Keys SecureIf the secret is leaked, tokens can be forged.For , use strong, randomly generated secret keys.For , protect the  carefully. Never expose it on the client or in version control.Choose Strong Signing AlgorithmsAvoid  at all costs. Some older libraries allowed this, disabling signature checks. Make sure your library  tokens with .Choose strong algorithms like , , or  Avoid older/weaker ones.Always Verify the SignatureThis is the core of JWT security. Never trust a token without validating its signature.These claims are essential for ensuring a token is legitimate and appropriate for your service: – Always set and validate it. Short-lived tokens are generally more secure. – Optional, but if present, should be checked. – Ensure the token was meant for your application. – Confirm the token was issued by a trusted source.Don’t Include Sensitive Data in the PayloadJWT payloads are Base64Url-encoded, not encrypted. Anyone can decode and read them. Never include secrets, passwords, or sensitive personal data.Handle Token Expiration and RevocationJWTs are stateless, which means once issued, they can’t be revoked easily. You must design with that in mind. – Issue access tokens that expire quickly (e.g., 15 minutes). – Use longer-lived refresh tokens to issue new access tokens. Refresh tokens can be revoked if needed. – Keep a list of revoked tokens or JTIs. This reintroduces server-side state but allows targeted revocation. – Use the  claim to uniquely identify tokens and track their usage (optional and stateful).Secure Storage on the ClientlocalStorage/sessionStorage – Easy but vulnerable to . – Safer from XSS, but requires additional care for  protection.Best practice for web apps: Use  and refresh tokens in HttpOnly cookies to balance security and usability.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content every week.This post is public so feel free to share it.

This blog post explores how to build custom event aggregation systems that help engineering teams better understand cluster behavior and troubleshoot issues more effectively.The challenge with Kubernetes eventsIn a Kubernetes cluster, events are generated for various operations - from pod scheduling and container starts to volume mounts and network configurations. While these events are invaluable for debugging and monitoring, several challenges emerge in production environments:: Large clusters can generate thousands of events per minute: Default event retention is limited to one hour: Related events from different components are not automatically linked: Events lack standardized severity or category classifications: Similar events are not automatically groupedTo learn more about Events in Kubernetes, read the Event API reference.Consider a production environment with tens of microservices where the users report intermittent transaction failures:Traditional event aggregation process: Engineers are wasting hours sifting through thousands of standalone events spread across namespaces. By the time they look into it, the older events have long since purged, and correlating pod restarts to node-level issues is practically impossible.With its event aggregation in its custom events: The system groups events across resources, instantly surfacing correlation patterns such as volume mount timeouts before pod restarts. History indicates it occurred during past record traffic spikes, highlighting a storage scalability issue in minutes rather than hours.The beneﬁt of this approach is that organizations that implement it commonly cut down their troubleshooting time significantly along with increasing the reliability of systems by detecting patterns early.Building an Event aggregation systemThis post explores how to build a custom event aggregation system that addresses these challenges, aligned to Kubernetes best practices. I've picked the Go programming language for my example.This event aggregation system consists of three main components:: Monitors the Kubernetes API for new events: Processes, categorizes, and correlates events: Stores processed events for longer retentionHere's a sketch for how to implement the event watcher:Event processing and classificationThe event processor enriches events with additional context and classification:Implementing Event correlationOne of the key features you could implement is a way of correlating related Events.
Here's an example correlation strategy:Event storage and retentionFor long-term storage and analysis, you'll probably want a backend that supports:Efficient querying of large event volumesFlexible retention policiesSupport for aggregation queriesHere's a sample storage interface:Good practices for Event managementImplement rate limiting for event processingUse efficient filtering at the API server levelBatch events for storage operationsDistribute event processing across multiple workersUse leader election for coordinationImplement backoff strategies for API rate limitsHandle API server disconnections gracefullyBuffer events during storage backend unavailabilityImplement retry mechanisms with exponential backoffImplement pattern detection to identify recurring issues:With this implementation, the system can identify recurring patterns such as node pressure events, pod scheduling failures, or networking issues that occur with a specific frequency.The following example provides a starting point for building an alerting system based on event patterns. It is not a complete solution but a conceptual sketch to illustrate the approach.A well-designed event aggregation system can significantly improve cluster observability and troubleshooting capabilities. By implementing custom event processing, correlation, and storage, operators can better understand cluster behavior and respond to issues more effectively.The solutions presented here can be extended and customized based on specific requirements while maintaining compatibility with the Kubernetes API and following best practices for scalability and reliability.Future enhancements could include:Machine learning for anomaly detectionIntegration with popular observability platformsCustom event APIs for application-specific eventsEnhanced visualization and reporting capabilities]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Using `make` to compile C programs (for non-C-programmers)</title><link>https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/06/10/how-to-compile-a-c-program/</link><author>Julia Evans</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://jvns.ca/atom.xml">Dev - Julia Evans</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I have never been a C programmer but every so often I need to compile a C/C++
program from source. This has been kind of a struggle for me: for a
long time, my approach was basically “install the dependencies, run , if
it doesn’t work, either try to find a binary someone has compiled or give up”.“Hope someone else has compiled it” worked pretty well when I was running Linux
but since I’ve been using a Mac for the last couple of years I’ve been running
into more situations where I have to actually compile programs myself.So let’s talk about what you might have to do to compile a C program! I’ll use
a couple of examples of specific C programs I’ve compiled and talk about a few
things that can go wrong. Here are three programs we’ll be talking about
compiling:qf (a pager you can run to quickly open files from a search with )This is pretty simple: on an Ubuntu system if I don’t already have a C compiler I’ll install one with:sudo apt-get install build-essential
This installs , , and . The situation on a Mac is more
confusing but it’s something like “install xcode command line tools”.step 2: install the program’s dependenciesUnlike some newer programming languages, C doesn’t have a dependency manager.
So if a program has any dependencies, you need to hunt them down yourself.
Thankfully because of this, C programmers usually keep their dependencies very
minimal and often the dependencies will be available in whatever package manager you’re using.There’s almost always a section explaining how to get the dependencies in the
README, for example in paperjam’s README, it
says:To compile PaperJam, you need the headers for the libqpdf and libpaper libraries (usually available as libqpdf-dev and libpaper-dev packages).You may need  (found in AsciiDoc) for building manual pages.So on a Debian-based system you can install the dependencies like this.sudo apt install -y libqpdf-dev libpaper-dev
If a README gives a name for a package (like ), I’d basically
always assume that they mean “in a Debian-based Linux distro”: if you’re on a
Mac  will not work. I still have not 100% gotten
the hang of developing on a Mac yet so I don’t have many tips there yet. I
guess in this case it would be  if you’re using Homebrew.step 3: run  (if needed)Some C programs come with a  and some instead come with a script called
. For example, if you download sqlite’s source code, it has a  script in
it instead of a Makefile.My understanding of this  script is:You run it, it prints out a lot of somewhat inscrutable output, and then it
either generates a  or fails because you’re missing some
dependencyThe  script is part of a system called
autotools
that I have never needed to learn anything about beyond “run it to generate
a ”.I think there might be some options you can pass to get the 
script to produce a different  but I have never done that.The next step is to run  to try to build a program. Some notes about
:Sometimes you can run  to parallelize the build and make it go
fasterIt usually prints out a million compiler warnings when compiling the program.
I always just ignore them. I didn’t write the software! The compiler warnings
are not my problem.Here’s an error I got while compiling  on my Mac:/opt/homebrew/Cellar/qpdf/12.0.0/include/qpdf/InputSource.hh:85:19: error: function definition does not declare parameters
   85 |     qpdf_offset_t last_offset{0};
      |                   ^
Over the years I’ve learned it’s usually best not to overthink problems like
this: if it’s talking about , there’s a good change it just means that
I’ve done something wrong with how I’m including the  dependency.Now let’s talk about some ways to get the  dependency included in the right way.Before we talk about how to fix dependency problems: building C programs is split into 2
steps: the code into  (with  or ) those object files into a final binary (with )It’s important to know this when building a C program because sometimes you
need to pass the right flags to the compiler and linker to tell them where to
find the dependencies for the program you’re compiling.If I run  on my Mac to install , I get this error:c++ -o paperjam paperjam.o pdf-tools.o parse.o cmds.o pdf.o -lqpdf -lpaper
ld: library 'qpdf' not found
This is not because  is not installed on my system (it actually is!). But
the compiler and linker don’t know how to  the  library. To fix this, we need to:pass "-I/opt/homebrew/include" to the compiler (to tell it where to find the header files)pass "-L/opt/homebrew/lib -liconv" to the linker (to tell it where to find library files and to link in )And we can get  to pass those extra parameters to the compiler and linker using environment variables!
To see how this works: inside ’s Makefile you can see a bunch of environment variables, like  here:paperjam: $(OBJS)
	$(LD) -o $@ $^ $(LDLIBS)
Everything you put into the  environment variable gets passed to the
linker () as a command line argument.secret environment variable:  sometimes define their own environment variables that they pass to
the compiler/linker, but  also has a bunch of “implicit” environment
variables which it will automatically pass to the C compiler and linker. There’s a full list of implicit environment variables here,
but one of them is , which gets automatically passed to the C compiler.(technically it would be more normal to use  for this, but this
particular  hardcodes  so setting  was the only
way I could find to set the compiler flags without editing the )
As an aside: it took me a long time to realize how closely tied to C/C++ `make` is -- I used
to think that `make` was just a general build system (and of course you can use it for
anything!) but it has a lot of affordances for building C/C++ programs that it
doesn't have for building any other kind of program.
two ways to pass environment variables to I learned thanks to @zwol that there are actually two ways to pass environment variables to : (the usual way)The difference between them is that  will override the
value of  set in the  but  won’t.I’m not sure which way is the norm but I’m going to use the first way in this
post.Now that we’ve talked about how  and  get passed to the
compiler and linker, here’s the final incantation that I used to get the
program to build successfully!CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/include" LDLIBS="-L/opt/homebrew/lib -liconv" make paperjam
This passes  to the compiler and -L/opt/homebrew/lib -liconv to the linker.Also I don’t want to pretend that I “magically” knew that those were the right
arguments to pass, figuring them out involved a bunch of confused Googling that I
skipped over in this post. I will say that:the  compiler flag tells the compiler which directory to find header files in, like /opt/homebrew/include/qpdf/QPDF.hhthe  linker flag tells the linker which directory to find libraries in, like /opt/homebrew/lib/libqpdf.athe  linker flag tells the linker which libraries to link in, like  means “link in the  library”, or  means “link ”tip: how to just build 1 specific file: Yesterday I discovered this cool tool called
qf which you can use to quickly
open files from the output of . is in a big directory of various tools, but I only wanted to compile .
So I just compiled , like this:Basically if you know (or can guess) the output filename of the file you’re
trying to build, you can tell  to just build that file by running tip: you don’t need a MakefileI sometimes write 5-line C programs with no dependencies, and I just learned
that if I have a file called , I can just compile it like this without creating a :It gets automaticaly expanded to , which saves a bit of
typing. I have no idea if I’m going to remember this (I might just keep typing
 anyway) but it seems like a fun trick.tip: look at how other packaging systems built the same C programIf you’re having trouble building a C program, maybe other people had problems building it
too! Every Linux distribution has build files for every package that they
build, so even if you can’t install packages from that distribution directly,
maybe you can get tips from that Linux distro for how to build the package.
Realizing this (thanks to my friend Dave) was a huge ah-ha moment for me.  env.NIX_LDFLAGS = lib.optionalString stdenv.hostPlatform.isDarwin "-liconv";
This is basically saying “pass the linker flag  to build this on a
Mac”, so that’s a clue we could use to build it.That same file also says   env.NIX_CFLAGS_COMPILE = "-DPOINTERHOLDER_TRANSITION=1";. I’m not sure what this means, but when I try
to build the  package I do get an error about something called a
, so I guess that’s somehow related to the “PointerHolder
transition”.step 5: installing the binaryOnce you’ve managed to compile the program, probably you want to install it somewhere!
Some s have an  target that let you install the tool on your
system with . I’m always a bit scared of this (where is it going
to put the files? what if I want to uninstall them later?), so if I’m compiling
a pretty simple program I’ll often just manually copy the binary to install it
instead, like this:step 6: maybe make your own package!Once I figured out how to do all of this, I realized that I could use my new
 knowledge to contribute a  package to Homebrew! Then I could
just  on future systems.The good thing is that even if the details of how all of the different
packaging systems, they fundamentally all use C compilers and linkers.it can be useful to understand a little about C even if you’re not a C programmerI think all of this is an interesting example of how it can useful to
understand some basics of how C programs work (like “they have header files”)
even if you’re never planning to write a nontrivial C program if your life.It feels good to have some ability to compile C/C++ programs myself, even
though I’m still not totally confident about all of the compiler and linker
flags and I still plan to never learn anything about how autotools works other
than “you run  to generate the ”.Two things I left out of this post:LD_LIBRARY_PATH / DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH (which you use to tell the dynamic
linker at runtime where to find dynamically linked files) because I can’t
remember the last time I ran into an  issue and couldn’t
find an example., which I think is important but I don’t understand yet]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Officer can’t go back to CAVA</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/OoBilWqFNME</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/OoBilWqFNME?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 9 Jun 2025 22:11:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Can Science and Faith Co-Exist?

Mario Kart World, the banner game for the launch of the Switch 2, carries with it the expectation that of course this will be one of the games most associated with the system for its entire lifespan. The challenge was crafting a new game that felt sufficiently suited to carry those expectations. Due to its blend of skillful mechanical tweaks, lovely aesthetics, and a general design philosophy built around delightful surprises, this one will go the distance.The biggest standout feature of Mario Kart World--the one that its name, identity, and many of its mechanics revolve around--is the world itself. For the first time in the series history the races aren't built as standalone tracks, but rather as part of a large contiguous map. Iconic locations like Bowser's Castle or Moo Moo Meadows are physical locations connected to each other through a series of highways and byways. The Grand Prix cups, the ostensible story campaign of a Mario Kart game, are just routes through this world the same way a real street race will block off a specific route.Within that context, though, the races themselves are more dynamic than ever. Nintendo has started licensing its properties out for theme park attractions since the release of the last Mario Kart, and it's hard not to notice the roller coaster-like approach to these tracks. Like a well-designed ride, you're consistently confronted with surprises and obstacles that keep things visually interesting and mechanically exciting. A race along the savannah will feature adorably plump animals like a herd of zebra, while a desert area surprises you with the Easter Island-like Tokotoko enemies from Super Mario Land, and another track may fling you into the air or have you navigate choppy waters. It's a treat for longtime Nintendo fans, especially, as the wealth of references goes much deeper than it has before.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Never. Let.

Check out the new 'After Dark' YouTube Channel! - https://www.youtube.com/@AfterDarkHistoryHit

Join Maddy Pelling and Anthony Delaney on the dark streets of Edinburgh as they investigate the infamous nineteenth century case of Burke and Hare: Scotland’s most notorious serial killers. 

William Burke and William Hare murdered for money, killing in cold blood at least 16 times, so that they could sell the bodies of their victims to the anatomist table. 

Anthony follows the story of their horrific crimes right up to Edinburgh’s high society, to the medical establishment so bent on scientific progress it fuelled a clandestine trade in bodies. 

Maddy examines the evidence we have about the victims' lives, the poor and itinerant people who made their livings in Edinburgh’s crowded Old Town. Those unlucky people who tragically crossed Burke and Hare’s murderous path were targeted because of their isolation… but there was always more to their stories… 

The murders could only go on for so long… and Burke and Hare’s downfall, trial and the public execution of Burke caused a media storm. The killings made headlines and haunted the public in Edinburgh and across the world. 

Anthony and Maddy consider the unanswered questions of the case: how much did flamboyant Doctor Knox, who bought the bodies, know about where they had come from, how complicit were the men’s partners in their crimes… and what happened to William Hare.

For decades, the American right has stayed on brand: the economy. Low taxes. Free markets. Deregulation. Those have been the buzzwords for more than half a century. But that doctrine is now being challenged by other conservatives who envision a future in which America’s trade deficit is lower, manufacturing returns to the US, and Americans buy more American-made products.
Is this future even possible?

Economist Oren Cass thinks it is. In today’s episode, the founder of the think tank America Compass speaks to Sean about right-wing economic populism. The two discuss a conservative, pro-worker approach to economic policy, Cass’s plan to bring manufacturing back to the US, and what types of behavior economic policy should incentivize.

The escape routes they used, established by Nazi sympathisers, came to be known as 'ratlines'. The escaping Nazis had helped from an unexpected source; senior figures within the Catholic Church.The story of SS officer Walter Rauff exemplifies how these networks operated and the subsequent lives of the escapees. Rauff was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people during the Second World War and was a key perpetrator of the Holocaust. After escaping to Chile, he would eventually come to work for the brutal Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. There he would go on to inflict further miseries on the Chilean people. Rauff was never put on trial, but is it possible to obtain a different kind of justice for his numerous crimes?Philippe Sands, a renowned British-French lawyer and author, joins Dan to provide insights from his book '38 Londres Street: On Impunity, Pinochet in England and a Nazi in Patagonia', which explores Rauff's life and actions and the involvement of the Catholic Church.Produced & edited by Dougal Patmore.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Living in Walter White&apos;s House &amp; Dodging Pizzas: 5CAST w/ Andrew Callaghan (#7) ft.

In recent years, they’ve also become essential for training large language models (LLMs) by collecting massive amounts of publicly available text data from across the internet.At its core, crawling seems simple:Start with a list of known URLs (called )However, designing a crawler that can operate at , processing billions or even trillions of pages, is anything but simple. It introduces several complex engineering challenges like:How do we prioritize which pages to crawl first?How do we ensure we don’t overload the target servers?How do we avoid redundant crawling of the same URL or content?How do we split the work across hundreds or thousands of crawler nodes?In this article, we’ll walk through the end-to-end design of a scalable, distributed web crawler. We’ll start with the requirements, map out the high-level architecture, explore database and storage options, and dive deep into the core components.Before we start drawing boxes and arrows, let's define what our crawler needs to do.1.1 Functional Requirements Given a URL, the crawler should be able to download the corresponding content. Save the fetched content for downstream use. Parse the HTML to discover hyperlinks and identify new URLs to crawl. Prevent redundant crawling and storage of the same URL or content. Both URL-level and content-level deduplication should be supported. Follow site-specific crawling rules defined in  files, including disallowed paths and crawl delays.Handle Diverse Content Types: Support HTML as a primary format, but also be capable of recognizing and handling other formats such as PDFs, XML, images, and scripts. Support recrawling of pages based on content volatility. Frequently updated pages should be revisited more often than static ones.1.2 Non-Functional Requirements The system should scale horizontally to crawl billions of pages across a large number of domains. The crawler should avoid overwhelming target servers by limiting the rate of requests to each domain. The architecture should allow for easy integration of new modules, such as custom parsers, content filters, storage backends, or processing pipelines.Robustness & Fault Tolerance: The crawler should gracefully handle failures whether it's a bad URL, a timeout, or a crashing worker node without disrupting the overall system. The crawler should maintain high throughput (pages per second), while also minimizing fetch latency.In a real system design interview, you may only be expected to address a subset of these requirements. Focus on what’s relevant to the problem you’re asked to solve, and clarify assumptions early in the discussion.2.1 Number of Pages to CrawlAssume we aim to crawl a subset of the web, not the entire internet, but a meaningful slice. This includes pages across blogs, news sites, e-commerce platforms, documentation pages, and forums.Additional Metadata (headers, timestamps, etc.): ~10 KBTotal Data Volume = 1 billion pages × 110 KB = ~110 TBThis estimate covers only the raw HTML and metadata. If we store additional data like structured metadata, embedded files, or full-text search indexes, the storage requirements could grow meaningfully.Let’s assume we want to complete the crawl in . = 1 billion / 10 ≈  ≈ 1150 pages/sec 110 KB/page × 1150 pages/sec = ~126 MB/secThis means our system must be capable of:Making over 1150 HTTP requests per secondParsing and storing content at the same rateEvery page typically contains several outbound links, many of which are unique. This causes the  (queue of URLs to visit) to grow rapidly. Average outbound links per page: 5New links discovered per second =  1150 (pages per second) * 5 = 5750The URL Frontier's needs to handle thousands of new URL submissions per second. We’ll need efficient , , and  to handle this at scale.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Bill Atkinson, Hypercard Creator and Original Mac Team Member, Dies at Age 74</title><link>https://apple.slashdot.org/story/25/06/08/016210/bill-atkinson-hypercard-creator-and-original-mac-team-member-dies-at-age-74?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Sun, 8 Jun 2025 01:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ AppleInsider reports:

The engineer behind much of the Mac's early graphical user interfaces, QuickDraw, MacPaint, Hypercard and much more, William D. "Bill" Atkinson, died on June 5 of complications from pancreatic cancer... 
Atkinson, who built a post-Apple career as a noted nature photographer, worked at Apple from 1978 to 1990. Among his lasting contributions to Apple's computers were the invention of the menubar, the selection lasso, the "marching ants" item selection animation, and the discovery of a midpoint circle algorithm that enabled the rapid drawing of circles on-screen. 
He was Apple Employee No. 51, recruited by Steve Jobs. Atkinson was one of the 30 team members to develop the first Macintosh, but also was principle designer of the Lisa's graphical user interface (GUI), a novelty in computers at the time. He was fascinated by the concept of dithering, by which computers using dots could create nearly photographic images similar to the way newspapers printed photos. He is also credited (alongside Jobs) for the invention of RoundRects, the rounded rectangles still used in Apple's system messages, application windows, and other graphical elements on Apple products. 
Hypercard was Atkinson's main claim to fame. He built the a hypermedia approach to building applications that he once described as a "software erector set." The Hypercard technology debuted in 1987, and greatly opened up Macintosh software development.
 
In 2012 some video clips of Atkinson appeared in some rediscovered archival footage. (Original Macintosh team developer Andy Hertzfeld uploaded "snippets from interviews with members of the original Macintosh design team, recorded in October 1983 for projected TV commercials that were never used.") 

Blogger John Gruber calls Atkinson "One of the great heroes in not just Apple history, but computer history."

 If you want to cheer yourself up, go to Andy Hertzfeld's Folklore.org site and (re-)read all the entries about Atkinson. Here's just one, with Steve Jobs inspiring Atkinson to invent the roundrect. Here's another (surely near and dear to my friend Brent Simmons's heart) with this kicker of a closing line: "I'm not sure how the managers reacted to that, but I do know that after a couple more weeks, they stopped asking Bill to fill out the form, and he gladly complied." 

Some of his code and algorithms are among the most efficient and elegant ever devised. The original Macintosh team was chock full of geniuses, but Atkinson might have been the most essential to making the impossible possible under the extraordinary technical limitations of that hardware... In addition to his low-level contributions like QuickDraw, Atkinson was also the creator of MacPaint (which to this day stands as the model for bitmap image editorsâ — âPhotoshop, I would argue, was conceptually derived directly from MacPaint) and HyperCard ("inspired by a mind-expanding LSD journey in 1985"), the influence of which cannot be overstated.

 I say this with no hyperbole: Bill Atkinson may well have been the best computer programmer who ever lived. Without question, he's on the short list. What a man, what a mind, what gifts to the world he left us.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Harvard students have been getting doxxed</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/aS49-qNB2WY</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/aS49-qNB2WY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 7 Jun 2025 23:33:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cult Of The Dead: How Pharaohs Cheated Death In Ancient Egypt</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jR_Yjvk8GM</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/4jR_Yjvk8GM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 7 Jun 2025 21:00:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Egypt: New Discoveries, Ancient Mysteries dives deep into the "Cult of the Dead," exploring how pharaohs like Djoser and Tutankhamun prepared for eternity.

And to this day, they write, "my bias is to nod approvingly at touch typists and roll my eyes at those who need to stare at the keyboard while typing..." But how true is that for computer professionals today?

After 15 years I left industry and became a post-secondary computer science educator. Occasionally I rant to my students about the importance of touch-typing as a skill to have as a software engineer. 

But I've been out of the game for some time now. Those of you hiring or working with freshly-minted software engineers, what's your take? 

One anonymous Slashdot reader responded:

Oh, you mean the kid in the next cubicle that has said "Hey Siri" 297 times this morning? I'll let you know when he starts typing. A minor suggestion to office managers... please purchase a very quiet keyboard. Fellow cube-mates who are accomplished typists would consider that struggling audibly to be akin to nails on a blackboard... 
Share your own thoughts in the comments.

"In February, he finally posted his proof online, to widespread acclaim..."


Every algorithm takes some time to run, and requires some space to store data while it's running. Until now, the only known algorithms for accomplishing certain tasks required an amount of space roughly proportional to their runtime, and researchers had long assumed there's no way to do better. Williams' proof established a mathematical procedure for transforming any algorithm — no matter what it does — into a form that uses much less space. 
What's more, this result — a statement about what you can compute given a certain amount of space — also implies a second result, about what you cannot compute in a certain amount of time. This second result isn't surprising in itself: Researchers expected it to be true, but they had no idea how to prove it. Williams' solution, based on his sweeping first result, feels almost cartoonishly excessive, akin to proving a suspected murderer guilty by establishing an ironclad alibi for everyone else on the planet. It could also offer a new way to attack one of the oldest open problems in computer science. 

"It's a pretty stunning result, and a massive advance," said Paul Beame, a computer scientist at the University of Washington.

Neil deGrasse Tyson, Chuck Nice, and Gary O’Reilly learn about Nobel-prize-winning Alphafold, the protein folding problem, and how solving it could end disease with AI researcher and Chief AI Officer of Isomorphic Labs, Max Jaderberg. 

We break down the protein folding problem and why it was so hard to crack. How do we learn to decode how strings of amino acids fold into complex, dynamic shapes that power our biology? How did AlphaFold crack this decades-old puzzle? We explore how Alphafold 3 uses the shapes of proteins to predict protein-drug interactions. How close are we to using AI and deep learning to design new medicines instead of discovering them by chance? Could generative AI invent molecules that precisely target the cause of a disease?

We take these ideas into the future: Could AI help us fix misfolded proteins that cause illness? Can we use these tools to create personalized drugs tailored to your unique genome? Will it make it economically feasible to treat rare diseases? Could this even help us slow aging or regenerate limbs, like salamanders do? Could this technology combat cancer, fix rare genetic disorders, or even digest plastic? And with quantum computing on the horizon, what happens when we combine it with AI? Will chemistry ever be done the same way again?

Donald Trump and Elon Musk have been locked in a public fight after Musk spent days bashing Trump's "big, beautiful bill" — a multi-trillion dollar budget key to unlocking the president's agenda currently being voted on in the Senate. In return, the president threatened to cut the federal government's contracts with Musk's companies, including SpaceX.

The FAIR Package Manager project is a response to the legal brawl that erupted last year, pitting WordPress co-creator Matthew Mullenweg, his for-profit hosting firm Automattic, and the WordPress Foundation that he controls, against WP Engine, a rival commercial WordPress hosting firm. [...]
 
The Linux Foundation says the FAIR Package Manager, a mechanism for distributing open-source WordPress plugins, "eliminates reliance on any single source for core updates, plugins, themes, and more, unites a fragmented ecosystem by bringing together plugins from any source, and builds security into the supply chain." In other words, it can't be weaponized against the WordPress community because it won't be controlled by any one entity. "The FAIR Package Manager project paves the way for the stability and growth of open source content management, giving contributors and businesses additional options governed by a neutral community," said Jim Zemlin, Executive Director of the Linux Foundation, in a canned press statement. "We look forward to the growth in community and contributions this important project attracts."
 
The FAIR Package Manager repo explains the software's purpose more succinctly. The software "is a decentralized alternative to the central WordPress.org plugin and theme ecosystem, designed to return control to WordPress hosts and developers. It operates as a drop-in WordPress plugin, seamlessly replacing existing centralized services with a federated, open-source infrastructure." In addition to providing some measure of stability, the Linux Foundation sees the FAIR Package Manager as advancing WordPress' alignment with Europe's General Data Protection Regulation by reducing automatic browser data transmission and telemetry sent to commercial entities, while also supporting modern security practices and strengthening the open source software supply chain.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What To Expect From Apple&apos;s WWDC</title><link>https://apple.slashdot.org/story/25/06/06/2147236/what-to-expect-from-apples-wwdc?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Fri, 6 Jun 2025 23:10:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference 25 (WWDC) kicks off next week, June 9th, showcasing the company's latest software and new technologies. That includes the next version of iOS, which is rumored to have the most significant design overhaul since the introduction of iOS 7. Here's an overview of what to expect: 
Major Software Redesigns 
Apple plans to shift its operating system naming to reflect the release year, moving from sequential numbers to year-based identifiers. Consequently, the upcoming releases will be labeled as iOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, etc., streamlining the versioning across platforms.
 
iOS 26 is anticipated to feature a glossy, glass-like interface inspired by visionOS, incorporating translucent elements and rounded buttons. This design language is expected to extend across iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS, promoting a cohesive user experience across devices. Core applications like Phone, Safari, and Camera are slated for significant redesigns, too. For instance, Safari may introduce a translucent, "glassy" address bar, aligning with the new visual aesthetics.
 
While AI is not expected to be the main focus due to Siri's current readiness, some AI-related updates are rumored. The Shortcuts app may gain "Apple Intelligence," enabling users to create shortcuts using natural language. It's also possible that Gemini will be offered as an option for AI functionalities on the iPhone, similar to ChatGPT.
 
Other App and Feature Updates 
The lock screen might display charging estimates, indicating how long it will take for the phone to fully charge. There's a rumor about bringing live translation features to AirPods. The Messages app could receive automatic translations and call support; the Music app might introduce full-screen animated lock screen art; and Apple Notes may get markdown support. Users may also only need to log into a captive Wi-Fi portal once, and all their devices will automatically be logged in.
 
Significant updates are expected for Apple Home. There's speculation about the potential announcement of a "HomePad" with a screen, Apple's competitor to devices like the Nest Hub Mini. A new dedicated Apple gaming app is also anticipated to replace Game Center.

If you're expecting new hardware, don't hold your breath. The event is expected to focus primarily on software developments. It may even see discontinued support for several older Intel-based Macs in macOS 26, including models like the 2018 MacBook Pro and the 2019 iMac, as Apple continues its transition towards exclusive support for Apple Silicon devices.

At its beating, mechanical heart, however, Lies of P's first DLC expansion is a tale of personal tragedy and vengeance. While developer Neowiz hasn't implemented any drastic changes to the game's underlying mechanics in Overture, its storytelling has improved, further building on the atmospheric Belle Epoque-infused world it created as a much darker and more twisted spin on Carlo Collodi's The Adventures of Pinocchio. "Most unfortunately, in the lives of puppets, there is always a 'but' that spoils everything," is a popular quote attributed to the Italian author. In the case of Overture, this is fortunately not the case.Rather than being a conventional prequel, Overture sees Geppetto's eponymous puppet travel back in time alongside his faithful companion, Gemini. You can access the DLC from Chapter 9 by heading to the Path of the Pilgrim stargazer, but it feels like post-game content in terms of difficulty, providing a sterner test than the base game's final act. After emerging in a snowy forest on the outskirts of Krat, you're challenged almost immediately by a giant, petrified polar bear with a torture cage wrapped around its head. There's no sort of onboarding process if you've been away for a while, but with a moveset combining charges, grab attacks, and rhythmic combos, this angry carnivore is perfect for relearning your parry and dodging skills on the fly.After the initial confusion surrounding how you ended up in the past, you're eventually hot on the heels of the Legendary Stalker--a mysterious figure who acts as a guide through Krat's final days of grandeur. At roughly 15 hours in length, there's less time to dabble, so Overture's pacing is tight, with the story's circumstances providing a sense of urgency and momentum. There's still intrigue and mystery, but it never drags and remains compelling throughout, even if you could make the argument that too much of the narrative is told through optional notes. While these letters, personal musings, and final words are well-written, it's the evocative imagery that stands out--particularly the macabre exhibitions staged by the game's villain with the corpses he leaves behind.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Anthropic releases custom AI chatbot for classified spy work</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/anthropic-releases-custom-ai-chatbot-for-classified-spy-work/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/claude_gov.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 6 Jun 2025 21:12:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On Thursday, Anthropic unveiled specialized AI models designed for US national security customers.

It employed an impressive kit of tools, including rooting exploits that bypassed security protections built into Android and functions for modifying the Android OS's all-powerful Zygote process. Google eventually updated Android to block the methods Triada used to infect devices.A year later, Triada returned, only this time, devices came pre-infected before they reached consumers’ hands. In 2019, Google confirmed that the supply-chain attack affected thousands of devices and that the company had once again taken measures to thwart it.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Adventures in babysitting coding agents (Friends)</title><link>https://changelog.com/friends/96</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/friends/96/changelog--friends-96.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 6 Jun 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The ever-provocative Steve Yegge joins us fresh off a vibe coding bender so productive, he wrote a book on the topic alongside award-winning author Gene Kim.

It is a region full of evidence of the connections early Christians made here with places and events in the Bible, from Moses to the baptism of Jesus.

The journey begins overlooking the Jordan Valley on Mount Nebo, the site of the death of Moses and a place of pilgrimage for centuries.
e
Near Mount Nebo, at Madaba, Dan discovers one of the most extraordinary maps of the ancient world, created by the Christian community here in the 5th century AD. It is a spectacular layout of the Holy Land and the world as these early Christians saw it, from Egypt to Lebanon, including a detailed representation of Jerusalem with the Church of the Holy Sepulchre at its heart. 

Travelling to the banks of the River Jordan itself, Dan then encounters archaeological discoveries revealing the veneration of this place’s association with Elijah and John the Baptist for centuries. This is believed to be Bethany Beyond the Jordan, a location where faith and history coincide as excavations have uncovered 5th century AD buildings commemorating the spot where early Christians believed John baptised Jesus and where His ministry began.

This is a fascinating journey into the past and the powerful connections made between faith and real places on the ground for millennia.

The Stanford professor and former Google Brain scientist said the term misleads people into imagining engineers just "go with the vibes" when using AI tools to write code. "It's unfortunate that that's called vibe coding," Ng said at a firechat chat in May at conference LangChain Interrupt. "It's misleading a lot of people into thinking, just go with the vibes, you know -- accept this, reject that." 

In reality, coding with AI is "a deeply intellectual exercise," he said. "When I'm coding for a day with AI coding assistance, I'm frankly exhausted by the end of the day." Despite his gripe with the name, Ng is bullish on AI-assisted coding. He said it's "fantastic" that developers can now write software faster with these tools, sometimes while "barely looking at the code."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Only NASA Images from Beneath Venus&apos;s Clouds</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-mxLydV2kg</link><author>Astrum</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/K-mxLydV2kg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 5 Jun 2025 16:00:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-9b7aDP6ZN0coj9-xFnrtw">Astrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Astrum Venus posters on Displate: https://astrumspace.info/Displates

--

In 1943, chemist Albert Hofmann accidentally exposed himself to a drug he derived from ergot fungus and recorded its unexpected, mind-altering effects. The drug, lysergic acid diethylamide— or LSD— was soon heralded for its psychiatric potential. But how do LSD and other psychedelic drugs affect the body? And can they actually be medicinal? Anees Bahji explores the science of psychedelics.

Some companies use XML as a data serialization format or for configuration. Recently, I needed to learn how to uncomment some lines in an XML file to enable some settings that were defined in the XML.Fortunately, Python’s  module provides a way to do this. Let’s find out how!AI Answers Might Not WorkWhen I used Google to search for an answer to this question: “How to edit comments in XML with Python”, Google Gemini piped up with this answer:import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

xml_file = "PATH_TO_XML"

tree = ET.parse(xml_file)
root = tree.getroot()

for element in root.iter():
    if isinstance(element.tag, str) and element.tag.startswith('{'):
        continue
    if element.tag == ET.Comment:
        text = element.text.strip()
        print(text)Unfortunately, this code does not work. But it is close.If you look through StackOverflow and similar forums, you will discover that you need a custom parser. Here’s how to create one:import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

xml_file = r"PATH_TO_XML"

parser = ET.XMLParser(target=ET.TreeBuilder(insert_comments=True))
tree = ET.parse(xml_file, parser)
root = tree.getroot()

for element in root.iter():
    if isinstance(element.tag, str) and element.tag.startswith('{'):
        continue

    if element.tag == ET.Comment:
        text = element.text.strip()        
        print(text)The key point here is to create an instance of ET.XMLParser and set  to True. Then the code will work.Note that this example just prints out the commented text. You would need to do something like this to grab the commented text and reinsert it as a valid XML element:for element in root.iter():
   if isinstance(element.tag, str) and element.tag.startswith('{'):
      continue
   if element.tag == ET.Comment:
      text = element.text.strip()
      if "COMMENTED CODE SUBSTRING" in text:
         new_element = ET.fromstring(f"<{text}>")
         # Insert the uncommented text as a new XML element
         root.insert(list(root).index(element), new_element)
         # Remove the element that was commented out originally
         root.remove(element)

# Make indentation work for the output
ET.indent(tree, space="\t", level=0)

with open(XML_PATH, "wb") as f:
   tree.write(f)Here, you loop over each element or tag in the XML. You check if the element is a comment type. If it is, you check for the substring you are looking for in the comment’s text. When you find the substring, you extract the entire string from the comment, create a new element, insert it as a regular element, and remove the comment.XML is a handy format, and Python includes several different methods of working with XML in its  module. Several different third-party XML modules, such as lxml, are also great alternatives. If you work with XML, hopefully you will find this article helpful.Have fun and happy coding!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>We&apos;re all Builders now (Interview)</title><link>https://changelog.com/podcast/644</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/podcast/644/the-changelog-644.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 5 Jun 2025 12:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We’re on location at Microsoft Build 2025 with Amanda Silver, Corporate Vice President of Microsoft’s Developer Division.

on Kubernetes. Unlike typical short-lived, stateless web requests, LLM inference sessions are often
long-running, resource-intensive, and partially stateful. For example, a single GPU-backed model server
may keep multiple inference sessions active and maintain in-memory token caches.Traditional load balancers focused on HTTP path or round-robin lack the specialized capabilities needed
for these workloads. They also don’t account for model identity or request criticality (e.g., interactive
chat vs. batch jobs). Organizations often patch together ad-hoc solutions, but a standardized approach
is missing.Gateway API Inference ExtensionGateway API Inference Extension was created to address
this gap by building on the existing Gateway API, adding inference-specific
routing capabilities while retaining the familiar model of Gateways and HTTPRoutes. By adding an inference
extension to your existing gateway, you effectively transform it into an , enabling you to
self-host GenAI/LLMs with a “model-as-a-service” mindset.The project’s goal is to improve and standardize routing to inference workloads across the ecosystem. Key
objectives include enabling model-aware routing, supporting per-request criticalities, facilitating safe model
roll-outs, and optimizing load balancing based on real-time model metrics. By achieving these, the project aims
to reduce latency and improve accelerator (GPU) utilization for AI workloads.The design introduces two new Custom Resources (CRDs) with distinct responsibilities, each aligning with a
specific user persona in the AI/ML serving workflow​:InferencePool
Defines a pool of pods (model servers) running on shared compute (e.g., GPU nodes). The platform admin can
configure how these pods are deployed, scaled, and balanced. An InferencePool ensures consistent resource
usage and enforces platform-wide policies. An InferencePool is similar to a Service but specialized for AI/ML
serving needs and aware of the model-serving protocol.InferenceModel
A user-facing model endpoint managed by AI/ML owners. It maps a public name (e.g., "gpt-4-chat") to the actual
model within an InferencePool. This lets workload owners specify which models (and optional fine-tuning) they
want served, plus a traffic-splitting or prioritization policy.In summary, the InferenceModel API lets AI/ML owners manage what is served, while the InferencePool lets platform
operators manage where and how it’s served.The flow of a request builds on the Gateway API model (Gateways and HTTPRoutes) with one or more extra inference-aware
steps (extensions) in the middle. Here’s a high-level example of the request flow with the
Endpoint Selection Extension (ESE):
A client sends a request (e.g., an HTTP POST to /completions). The Gateway (like Envoy) examines the HTTPRoute
and identifies the matching InferencePool backend.
Instead of simply forwarding to any available pod, the Gateway consults an inference-specific routing extension—
the Endpoint Selection Extension—to pick the best of the available pods. This extension examines live pod metrics
(queue lengths, memory usage, loaded adapters) to choose the ideal pod for the request.Inference-Aware Scheduling
The chosen pod is the one that can handle the request with the lowest latency or highest efficiency, given the
user’s criticality or resource needs. The Gateway then forwards traffic to that specific pod.This extra step provides a smarter, model-aware routing mechanism that still feels like a normal single request to
the client. Additionally, the design is extensible—any Inference Gateway can be enhanced with additional inference-specific
extensions to handle new routing strategies, advanced scheduling logic, or specialized hardware needs. As the project
continues to grow, contributors are encouraged to develop new extensions that are fully compatible with the same underlying
Gateway API model, further expanding the possibilities for efficient and intelligent GenAI/LLM routing.We evaluated ​this extension against a standard Kubernetes Service for a vLLM‐based model
serving deployment. The test environment consisted of multiple H100 (80 GB) GPU pods running vLLM (version 1)
on a Kubernetes cluster, with 10 Llama2 model replicas. The Latency Profile Generator (LPG)
tool was used to generate traffic and measure throughput, latency, and other metrics. The
ShareGPT
dataset served as the workload, and traffic was ramped from 100 Queries per Second (QPS) up to 1000 QPS.: Throughout the tested QPS range, the ESE delivered throughput roughly on par with a standard
Kubernetes Service.: The ​ESE showed significantly lower p90 latency at higher QPS (500+), indicating that
its model-aware routing decisions reduce queueing and resource contention as GPU memory approaches saturation.: Similar trends emerged, with the ​ESE reducing end‐to‐end tail latencies compared to the
baseline, particularly as traffic increased beyond 400–500 QPS.These results suggest that this extension's model‐aware routing significantly reduced latency for GPU‐backed LLM
workloads. By dynamically selecting the least‐loaded or best‐performing model server, it avoids hotspots that can
appear when using traditional load balancing methods for large, long‐running inference requests.As the Gateway API Inference Extension heads toward GA, planned features include:Prefix-cache aware load balancing for remote caches for automated rollout between workloads in the same criticality band for scaling based on aggregate, per-model metricsSupport for large multi-modal inputs/outputs (e.g., diffusion models)Heterogeneous accelerators (serving on multiple accelerator types with latency- and cost-aware load balancing) for independently scaling poolsBy aligning model serving with Kubernetes-native tooling, Gateway API Inference Extension aims to simplify
and standardize how AI/ML traffic is routed. With model-aware routing, criticality-based prioritization, and
more, it helps ops teams deliver the right LLM services to the right users—smoothly and efficiently. Visit the project docs to dive deeper,
give an Inference Gateway extension a try with a few simple steps,
and get involved if you’re interested in

Crews on the ships of Christopher Columbus, Vasco De Gama and Ferdinand Magellan often sailed blind into uncharted waters, battling hurricanes and deadly reefs. With crude navigation tools, rotting food, and disease-ridden ships, survival was never guaranteed. Crews were pushed to their limits—physically, mentally, and morally. Some were deceived into the journey, and others driven by blind hope.In this episode, Dan is joined by Simon Parker, an associate professor in Medieval and Renaissance Portuguese at the University of Oxford, to tell some of the stories of extraordinary failure and disaster in the age of discovery.His new book is called Wreckers: Disaster in the Age of DiscoveryProduced by James Hickmann and edited by Dougal Patmore]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2331 - Jesse Michels</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Ldl70x5Fg</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/r9Ldl70x5Fg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 3 Jun 2025 17:01:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Jesse Michels is the creator and host of American Alchemy, a YouTube series exploring controversial topics in science and culture through longform interviews.

--

From the Chinese Loong to the Filipino Bakunawa, the Scottish Beithir and the Greek Hydra, dragons have inflamed imaginations for millennia. Their ubiquity across world mythology has led many scholars to ponder their possible origins. Could it be that tales of dragons were crafted to make sense of violent weather events? Timothy J. Burbery shares what geomythology has uncovered about dragons.

A war has been raging for decades in the jungles of Panama, as we fight one of the most terrifying parasites on Earth. It is so relentless that our best defense is to drop 100 million radiation-blasted, flesh-eating flies from the sky – every week.
It’s one of the most successful biological campaigns in history, but it’s a war we can never stop fighting… and one we can’t afford to lose.

I only care about page views, which I find useful to figure out which pages get the most traffic. It’s interesting data, and sometimes rather useful. But Google collects much more information than just page views, and it’s tracking is more intrusive than I would like. But I had other things I’d rather spend to spend my time on, so doing anything about it never made it high enough up my todo list.But last month I finally did something, having come across some information that did I thought did what I wanted. Essentially I want things set up so that I don’t need to bother with a cookie banner because I only track things that are trackable when someone says “deny all”. Based on some google documentation, I changed my google analytics fragment to:<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-6D51F4BDVF"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('consent', 'default', {
    'ad_user_data': 'denied',
    'ad_personalization': 'denied',
    'ad_storage': 'denied',
    'analytics_storage': 'denied',
    'wait_for_update': 500,
  });
  gtag('js', new Date());

  gtag('config', 'G-6D51F4BDVF');
</script>
As I understand the documentation, this should turn off the most problematic tracking, but still send a page view event. I took a look at it the following day, and everything seemed to be ok, but now, a couple of weeks later, page views reported by Google Analytics have dropped drastically. Not to zero, but to near zero.I’ve spent a bit of time trying to figure out what’s happening. I used google tag assistant and it indicates the page view events are being sent correctly. But that doesn’t explain why I’m not seeing the page views in my Google data.I’m not sure what to do next. I don’t want to spend too much time on this, after all I’d rather work on writing and editing. I did consider other services to do the tracking, but it looks we’re talking about $100s a month - and it’s just not worth that much to me. There are open source setups I could try an configure on my server, but again that’s effort I don’t really want to go into. Maybe I just live without analytics data.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How the US created an ambulance crisis</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWRlDIBoQW4</link><author>Vox</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/pWRlDIBoQW4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 3 Jun 2025 12:01:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA">Vox</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[And what can be done about it.

Thanks to our sponsor, T-Mobile: http://t-mobile.com/FirstResponders

Here's a pretty obvious statement: In the more rural, spread-out parts of the US, an ambulance will typically take a while to get to you. Makes sense. Driving a longer distance takes longer.

Here's the catch: other emergency services like police and fire don't actually have this same problem; it's relatively unique to ambulances. It turns out that emergency response time is about a little more than distance. Something is different about ambulances that is slowing them down in rural areas of the US.

That difference starts with the ways that ambulance services are funded in most of the US: Instead of being paid for by taxes like police and fire services are, ambulances are often paid for by a sort of a la carte model — the more people they take to the hospital, the more they get reimbursed. It's a model that works well for emergency services in densely populated areas, but less well for everyone else. In this video, we look at how exactly that translates into longer response times, and what can be done to fix it.

Note: A previous version of this video contained an incorrect graphic at 6:00. The graphic has been removed.

It’s replicated across , often spread across data centers around the world to ensure high availability, fault tolerance, and performance.This global distribution enables scalability but it comes with a critical challenge:How do we ensure every user and system component sees a consistent and accurate view of the data, especially when updates are happening all the time?This is where  come into play. They define the rules for how and when changes to data become visible across the system.Two of the most widely discussed models are: – where everyone sees the latest value, always. – where updates eventually propagate, but temporary inconsistencies are allowed.In this article, we'll break down these two models, explore their trade-offs, when to use each, and how to choose the right model depending on your application's goals.What is Data Consistency in Distributed System?In a , consistency is straightforward: when you write data, any subsequent read returns the most recent value. There’s only one copy of the data.But in , where data is replicated across multiple nodes (for availability, fault tolerance, or low latency), things become more complex.Imagine you write an update to . That change takes time to  to  and . During this , different nodes may temporarily hold  of the same data.Consistency Models define the  a system provides about: an update becomes visible it becomes visible (to which users or replicas) operations are seen across the systemIn essence, consistency models answer the question:“If I write a piece of data, when and under what conditions will others (or even I) see that new value?” guarantees that once a write is successfully completed, any read operation from any client or replica will reflect that write or a newer one. This means that the system always returns the most up-to-date value, regardless of where the read is performed.It behaves as if there is a single, globally synchronized copy of the data, and all operations occur in a clear and consistent global order.To achieve strong consistency, the system performs coordinated communication between replicas before confirming a write:A client sends a write request, such as updating a value in the database.The primary node (e.g., Node A) propagates this write to a group of replicas.Each replica (e.g., Node B, Node C) applies the write and sends an acknowledgment.Only after receiving acknowledgments from all (or enough) replicas does the system confirm the write as complete to the client.From that point onward, any read will return the updated value.This behavior is made possible through  that ensure all replicas agree on the order of operations. Common protocols used include Paxos and Raft.Simpler Application Logic: You don’t need to worry about stale data or implementing custom conflict resolution.: Easy to reason about; data reads always reflect the latest confirmed writes.: Ensures the highest level of data integrity and reliability.: Writes (and sometimes reads) may be slower because they require coordination between nodes, often across regions.: During network partitions or node failures, the system may reject requests to preserve consistency (as per the ).: Implementing strong consistency at scale requires sophisticated protocols and distributed coordination mechanisms.When to Use Strong ConsistencyStrong consistency is the right choice when your application needs immediate correctness and absolute accuracy. It is especially important when inconsistencies could result in lost data, incorrect decisions, or broken trust such as:Banking and financial systems: Balances and transactions must always be accurate.: You can’t afford to sell the same item to two people.: Locks must be exclusive and reflect the latest state.: Duplicate IDs must be prevented across replicas. is a  that guarantees all replicas in a distributed system will converge to the same value,  as long as no new updates are made.If you stop writing to a piece of data, and wait long enough, everyone will eventually see the same (latest) version of that data.There’s no guarantee about how soon this convergence happens. In the meantime, different replicas may serve  of the data leading to temporary inconsistencies.This model is often used in distributed systems where  and  are prioritized over immediate consistency.A client sends a  to a node, such as updating a data item on Node A.Node A acknowledges the write immediately, without waiting for other replicas to be updated.The updated value is asynchronously propagated to other replicas, such as Node B and Node C.While this propagation is in progress, reads from other replicas may return stale or outdated data.Once all replicas have received and applied the update, the system is .This replication process allows the system to stay highly available and responsive, even in the presence of network partitions or server failures.A temporary inconsistency is acceptable in many scenarios, especially when the data being read is not critical to business correctness and a slight delay in consistency does not harm the user experience.Let’s say you're using a social media platform and you update your profile picture.You immediately see the new photo on your profile.A friend on the other side of the world might still see your old photo for a few seconds due to .After the system finishes syncing, everyone sees the updated photo.This temporary inconsistency is acceptable because the correctness of the system doesn't depend on everyone seeing the same thing at the exact same moment.: Writes don’t need to wait for global coordination; responses are fast.: Nodes can accept reads and writes independently even during network partitions.: Ideal for large-scale, globally distributed systems that need to stay responsive under heavy load.Clients may read outdated data until replicas are fully synchronized.Increased Application Complexity: Developers must handle inconsistency in code especially in read-after-write scenarios.: If multiple replicas accept concurrent writes, you need a conflict resolution strategy (e.g., Last Write Wins, CRDTs).When to Use Eventual ConsistencyEventual consistency is a good fit for applications that require high availability and can tolerate temporary inconsistencies. It is especially effective when systems are distributed globally or need to operate at massive scale.Common use cases include: Like counts, shares, and view counters can tolerate brief inconsistencies without impacting user experience.Product view counts or analytics: Tracking page visits, clicks, or user events can tolerate minor delays in consistency.Personalized suggestions such as products, movies, or articles do not require real-time accuracy and benefit from fast, large-scale reads.DNS (Domain Name System): DNS records are cached at multiple layers worldwide. Slight delays in propagation are acceptable and help maintain global availability.Content delivery networks (CDNs): Static assets like images, stylesheets, and scripts are served from edge locations. Updates propagate gradually to balance performance and consistency. Eventual consistency is suitable when users add items from different devices. Conflict resolution strategies (such as merging or last-write-wins) help maintain a coherent experience.Variations and Client-Centric ModelsIt's important to note that "eventual consistency" is a broad term. There are stronger forms of eventual consistency that provide better guarantees: If operation A causally precedes operation B (e.g., B reads a value written by A), then all processes see A before B. Operations that are not causally related can be seen in different orders.In a comment thread, replies should appear after the comment they respond to even if the system is eventually consistent overall.Read-Your-Writes Consistency: After a client performs a write, any subsequent reads by that same client will always reflect the write (or a newer version). Other clients may still see stale data.You update your profile bio. When you refresh the page, your new bio appears immediately even if it takes a few seconds for others to see it.Monotonic Reads Consistency: If a client reads a value, any future reads by the same client will return the same or a newer value. The client will never see an older version of the data.You see your post has 10 likes. After refreshing, you might see 10 or 11 likes but never fewer than 10.Monotonic Writes Consistency: Writes from the same client are executed in the order they were issued by that client.You post two comments: “Hello” followed by “World.” Other users will always see “Hello” before “World.”Even in an eventually consistent system, applying client-centric guarantees helps preserve a sense of order, responsiveness, and trust for individual users.Choosing the Right Consistency ModelThere's no "best" consistency model. The right choice depends heavily on your application's specific requirements:How critical is it that all users see the most up-to-date, correct data at all times?High (e.g., financial transactions, inventory management)Lower (e.g., social likes, view counts, analytics)→ Eventual consistency is often sufficient.2. User Experience Expectations:Will users notice or care about stale data? Can the UI manage it gracefully?For systems where users expect immediate feedback, you can often use: updates (e.g., show the change immediately, then sync) (e.g., “Syncing…” or “Updating…”) reduces confusion, but  can be acceptable with the right UX design.3. Performance (Latency) RequirementsHow important is low latency for reads and writes? often delivers , since writes don’t block on global coordination. adds overhead especially in geo-distributed systems.4. Availability RequirementsCan the system tolerate downtime or errors during network partitions? may sacrifice  to preserve correctness (as per the CAP theorem). allows systems to  even during partial failures or network splits.Does the system need to support massive scale across regions or data centers?Eventually consistent systems scale more easily especially for . may limit scaling options due to coordination overhead.6. Development ComplexityHow much complexity are you willing to handle at the application layer? simplifies application logic. Developers can assume they’re always reading the latest state. requires handling: stale data, idempotent operations and conflict resolution.What happens if two users write conflicting data at the same time?In eventually consistent systems, concurrent writes to different replicas must be reconciled when replicas sync.CRDTs (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types)Custom merge logic based on application semanticsIf you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content every week.If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.This post is public so feel free to share it.

The main thing I’ll cover in this article is how to ensure that your sidecar containers start before the main app. It’s more complicated than you might think!I'd just like to remind readers that the v1.29.0 release of Kubernetes added native support for
sidecar containers, which can now be defined within the  field,
but with . You can see that illustrated in the following example Pod manifest snippet:What are the specifics of defining sidecars with a  block, rather than as a legacy multi-container pod with multiple ?
Well, all  are always launched  the main application. If you define Kubernetes-native sidecars, those are terminated  the main application. Furthermore, when used with Jobs, a sidecar container should still be alive and could potentially even restart after the owning Job is complete; Kubernetes-native sidecar containers do not block pod completion.Now you know that defining a sidecar with this native approach will always start it before the main application. From the kubelet source code, it's visible that this often means being started almost in parallel, and this is not always what an engineer wants to achieve. What I'm really interested in is whether I can delay the start of the main application until the sidecar is not just started, but fully running and ready to serve.
It might be a bit tricky because the problem with sidecars is there’s no obvious success signal, contrary to init containers - designed to run only for a specified period of time. With an init container, exit status 0 is unambiguously "I succeeded". With a sidecar, there are lots of points at which you can say "a thing is running".
Starting one container only after the previous one is ready is part of a graceful deployment strategy, ensuring proper sequencing and stability during startup. It’s also actually how I’d expect sidecar containers to work as well, to cover the scenario where the main application is dependent on the sidecar. For example, it may happen that an app errors out if the sidecar isn’t available to serve requests (e.g., logging with DataDog). Sure, one could change the application code (and it would actually be the “best practice” solution), but sometimes they can’t - and this post focuses on this use case.I'll explain some ways that you might try, and show you what approaches will really work.To check whether Kubernetes native sidecar delays the start of the main application until the sidecar is ready, let’s simulate a short investigation. Firstly, I’ll simulate a sidecar container which will never be ready by implementing a readiness probe which will never succeed. As a reminder, a readiness probe checks if the container is ready to start accepting traffic and therefore, if the pod can be used as a backend for services.(Unlike standard init containers, sidecar containers can have probes so that the kubelet can supervise the sidecar and intervene if there are problems. For example, restarting a sidecar container if it fails a health check.)From these logs it’s evident that only one container is ready - and I know it can’t be the sidecar, because I’ve defined it so it’ll never be ready (you can also check container statuses in ). I also saw that myapp has been started before the sidecar is ready. That was not the result I wanted to achieve; in this case, the main app container has a hard dependency on its sidecar.To ensure that the sidecar is ready before the main app container starts, I can define a . It will delay the start of the main container until the command is successfully executed (returns  exit status). If you’re wondering why I’ve added it to my , let’s analyse what happens If I’d added it to myapp container. I wouldn’t have guaranteed the probe would run before the main application code - and this one, can potentially error out without the sidecar being up and running.This results in 2/2 containers being ready and running, and from events, it can be inferred that the main application started only after nginx had already been started. But to confirm whether it waited for the sidecar readiness, let’s change the  to the exec type of command:and run  to watch in real time whether the readiness of both containers only changes after a 15 second delay. Again, events confirm the main application starts after the sidecar.
That means that using the  with a correct  request helps to delay the main application start until the sidecar is ready. It’s not optimal, but it works.What about the postStart lifecycle hook?Fun fact: using the  lifecycle hook block will also do the job, but I’d have to write my own mini-shell script, which is even less efficient.An interesting exercise would be to check the sidecar container behavior with a liveness probe.
A liveness probe behaves and is configured similarly to a readiness probe - only with the difference that it doesn’t affect the readiness of the container but restarts it in case the probe fails.After adding the liveness probe configured just as the previous readiness probe and checking events of the pod by  it’s visible that the sidecar has a restart count above 0. Nevertheless, the main application is not restarted nor influenced at all, even though I'm aware that (in our imaginary worst-case scenario) it can error out when the sidecar is not there serving requests.
What if I’d used a  without lifecycle ? Both containers will be immediately ready: at the beginning, this behavior will not be different from the one without any additional probes since the liveness probe doesn’t affect readiness at all. After a while, the sidecar will begin to restart itself, but it won’t influence the main container.I’ll summarize the startup behavior in the table below:Sidecar starts before the main app?Main app waits for the sidecar to be ready?What if the check doesn’t pass?, but it’s almost in parallel (effectively )Sidecar is not ready; main app continues runningYes, but it’s almost in parallel (effectively )Sidecar is restarted, main app continues running, main app container starts after  completes, but you have to provide custom logic for thatTo summarize: with sidecars often being a dependency of the main application, you may want to delay the start of the latter until the sidecar is healthy.
The ideal pattern is to start both containers simultaneously and have the app container logic delay at all levels, but it’s not always possible. If that's what you need, you have to use the right kind of customization to the Pod definition. Thankfully, it’s nice and quick, and you have the recipe ready above.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[ On | No ] syntactic support for error handling</title><link>https://go.dev/blog/error-syntax</link><author>Robert Griesemer</author><category>dev</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Tue, 3 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://blog.golang.org/feed.atom">Dev - Golang Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
      Robert Griesemer
      3 June 2025
      One of the oldest and most persistent complaints about Go concerns the verbosity of error handling.
We are all intimately (some may say painfully) familiar with this code pattern:x, err := call()
if err != nil {
        // handle err
}
The test  can be so pervasive that it drowns out the rest of the code.
This typically happens in programs that do a lot of API calls, and where handling errors
is rudimentary and they are simply returned.
Some programs end up with code that looks like this:func printSum(a, b string) error {
    x, err := strconv.Atoi(a)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    y, err := strconv.Atoi(b)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    fmt.Println("result:", x + y)
    return nil
}
Of the ten lines of code in this function body, only four (the calls and the last two lines) appear to do real work.
The remaining six lines come across as noise.
The verbosity is real, and so it’s no wonder that complaints about error handling have topped
our annual user surveys for years.
(For a while, the lack of generics surpassed complaints about error handling, but now that
Go supports generics, error handling is back on top.)The Go team takes community feedback seriously, and so for many years now we have tried to
come up with a solution for this problem, together with input from the Go community.The first explicit attempt by the Go team dates back to 2018, when Russ Cox
formally described the problem
as part of what we called the Go 2 effort at that time.
He outlined a possible solution based on a
draft design
by Marcel van Lohuizen.
The design was based on a  and  mechanism and was fairly comprehensive.
The draft includes a detailed analysis of alternative solutions, including comparisons with
approaches taken by other languages.
If you’re wondering if your particular error handling idea was previously considered,
read this document!// printSum implementation using the proposed check/handle mechanism.
func printSum(a, b string) error {
    handle err { return err }
    x := check strconv.Atoi(a)
    y := check strconv.Atoi(b)
    fmt.Println("result:", x + y)
    return nil
}
The  and  approach was deemed too complicated and almost a year later, in 2019,
we followed up with the much simplified and by now
infamous proposal.
It was based on the ideas of  and , but the  pseudo-keyword became
the  built-in function and the  part was omitted.
To explore the impact of the  built-in, we wrote a simple tool
(tryhard)
that rewrites existing error handling code using .
The proposal was argued over intensively, approaching 900 comments on the GitHub issue.// printSum implementation using the proposed try mechanism.
func printSum(a, b string) error {
    // use a defer statement to augment errors before returning
    x := try(strconv.Atoi(a))
    y := try(strconv.Atoi(b))
    fmt.Println("result:", x + y)
    return nil
}
However,  affected control flow by returning from the enclosing function in case of an error,
and did so from potentially deeply nested expressions, thus hiding this control flow from view.
This made the proposal unpalatable to many, and despite significant investment
into this proposal we decided to abandon this effort too.
In retrospect it might have been better to introduce a new keyword,
something that we could do now since we have fine-grained control over the language version
via  files and file-specific directives.
Restricting the use of  to assignments and statements might have alleviated some
of the other concerns. A recent proposal by Jimmy Frasche, which essentially
goes back to the original  and  design and addresses some of that design’s
shortcomings, pursues that direction.The repercussions of the  proposal led to much soul searching including a series of blog
posts by Russ Cox: “Thinking about the Go Proposal Process”.
One conclusion was that we likely diminished our chances for a better outcome by presenting an almost
fully baked proposal with little space for community feedback and a “threatening” implementation
timeline. Per “Go Proposal Process: Large Changes”:
“in retrospect,  was a large enough change that the new design we published […] should have
been a second draft design, not a proposal with an implementation timeline”.
But irrespective of a possible process and communication failure in this case, the user sentiment towards
the proposal was very strongly not in favor.We didn’t have a better solution at that time and didn’t pursue syntax changes for error handling for several years.
Plenty of people in the community were inspired, though, and we received a steady trickle
of error handling proposals, many very similar to each other, some interesting, some incomprehensible,
and some infeasible.
To keep track of the expanding landscape, another year later, Ian Lance Taylor created an
umbrella issue
which summarizes the current state of proposed changes for improved error handling.
A Go Wiki was created to collect related feedback, discussions, and articles.
Independently, other people have started tracking all the many error handling proposals
over the years.
It’s amazing to see the sheer volume of them all, for instance in Sean K. H. Liao’s blog post on
“go error handling proposals”.The complaints about the verbosity of error handling persisted
(see Go Developer Survey 2024 H1 Results),
and so, after a series of increasingly refined Go team internal proposals, Ian Lance Taylor published
“reduce error handling boilerplate using ” in 2024.
This time the idea was to borrow from a construct implemented in
Rust, specifically the
 operator.
The hope was that by leaning on an existing mechanism using an established notation, and taking into
account what we had learned over the years, we should be able to finally make some progress.
In small informal user studies where programmers were shown Go code using , the vast majority
of participants correctly guessed the meaning of the code, which further convinced us to give it another
shot.
To be able to see the impact of the change, Ian wrote a tool that converts ordinary Go code
into code that uses the proposed new syntax, and we also prototyped the feature in the
compiler.// printSum implementation using the proposed "?" statements.
func printSum(a, b string) error {
    x := strconv.Atoi(a) ?
    y := strconv.Atoi(b) ?
    fmt.Println("result:", x + y)
    return nil
}
Unfortunately, as with the other error handling ideas, this new proposal was also quickly overrun
with comments and many suggestions for minor tweaks, often based on individual preferences.
Ian closed the proposal and moved the content into a discussion
to facilitate the conversation and to collect further feedback.
A slightly modified version was received
a bit more positively
but broad support remained elusive.After so many years of trying, with three full-fledged proposals by the Go team and
literally hundreds (!)
of community proposals, most of them variations on a theme,
all of which failed to attract sufficient (let alone overwhelming) support,
the question we now face is: how to proceed? Should we proceed at all?To be more precise, we should stop trying to solve the , at least for the foreseeable
future.
The proposal process
provides justification for this decision:The goal of the proposal process is to reach general consensus about the outcome in a timely manner.
If proposal review cannot identify a general consensus in the discussion of the issue on the issue tracker,
the usual result is that the proposal is declined.It can happen that proposal review may not identify a general consensus and yet it is clear that the
proposal should not be outright declined.
[…]
If the proposal review group cannot identify a consensus nor a next step for the proposal,
the decision about the path forward passes to the Go architects […], who review the discussion and
aim to reach a consensus among themselves.None of the error handling proposals reached anything close to a consensus,
so they were all declined.
Even the most senior members of the Go team at Google do not unanimously agree
on the best path forward  (perhaps that will change at some point).
But without a strong consensus we cannot reasonably move forward.There are valid arguments in favor of the status quo:If Go had introduced specific syntactic sugar for error handling early on, few would argue over it today.
But we are 15 years down the road, the opportunity has passed, and Go has
a perfectly fine way to handle errors, even if it may seem verbose at times.Looking from a different angle, let’s assume we came across the perfect solution today.
Incorporating it into the language would simply lead from one unhappy group of users
(the one that roots for the change) to another (the one that prefers the status quo).
We were in a similar situation when we decided to add generics to the language, albeit with an
important difference:
today nobody is forced to use generics, and good generic libraries are written such that users
can mostly ignore the fact that they are generic, thanks to type inference.
On the contrary, if a new syntactic construct for error handling gets added to the language,
virtually everybody will need to start using it, lest their code become unidiomatic.Not adding extra syntax is in line with one of Go’s design rules:
do not provide multiple ways of doing the same thing.
There are exceptions to this rule in areas with high “foot traffic”: assignments come to mind.
Ironically, the ability to  a variable in
short variable declarations () was introduced to address a problem
that arose because of error handling:
without redeclarations, sequences of error checks require a differently named  variable for
each check (or additional separate variable declarations).
At that time, a better solution might have been to provide more syntactic support for error handling.
Then, the redeclaration rule may not have been needed, and with it gone, so would be various
associated complications.Going back to actual error handling code, verbosity fades into the background if errors are
actually .
Good error handling often requires additional information added to an error.
For instance, a recurring comment in user surveys is about the lack of stack traces associated
with an error.
This could be addressed with support functions that produce and return an augmented
error.
In this (admittedly contrived) example, the relative amount of boilerplate is much smaller:func printSum(a, b string) error {
    x, err := strconv.Atoi(a)
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("invalid integer: %q", a)
    }
    y, err := strconv.Atoi(b)
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("invalid integer: %q", b)
    }
    fmt.Println("result:", x + y)
    return nil
}
New standard library functionality can help reduce error handling boilerplate as well,
very much in the vein of Rob Pike’s 2015 blog post
“Errors are values”.
For instance, in some cases  may be used to deal with a
series of errors all at once:func printSum(a, b string) error {
    x, err1 := strconv.Atoi(a)
    y, err2 := strconv.Atoi(b)
    if err := cmp.Or(err1, err2); err != nil {
        return err
    }
    fmt.Println("result:", x+y)
    return nil
}
Writing, reading, and debugging code are all quite different activities.
Writing repeated error checks can be tedious, but today’s IDEs provide powerful, even LLM-assisted
code completion.
Writing basic error checks is straightforward for these tools.
The verbosity is most obvious when reading code, but tools might help here as well;
for instance an IDE with a Go language setting could provide a toggle switch to hide error handling
code.
Such switches already exist for other code sections such as function bodies.When debugging error handling code, being able to quickly add a  or
have a dedicated line or source location for setting a breakpoint in a debugger is helpful.
This is easy when there is already a dedicated  statement.
But if all the error handling logic is hidden behind a , , or , the code may have to
be changed into an ordinary  statement first, which complicates debugging
and may even introduce subtle bugs.There are also practical considerations:
Coming up with a new syntax idea for error handling is cheap;
hence the proliferation of a multitude of proposals from the community.
Coming up with a good solution that holds up to scrutiny: not so much.
It takes a concerted effort to properly design a language change and to actually implement it.
The real cost still comes afterwards:
all the code that needs to be changed, the documentation that needs to be updated,
the tools that need to be adjusted.
Taken all into account, language changes are very expensive, the Go team is relatively small,
and there are a lot of other priorities to address.
(These latter points may change: priorities can shift, team sizes can go up or down.)On a final note, some of us recently had the opportunity to attend
Google Cloud Next 2025,
where the Go team had a booth and where we also hosted a small Go Meetup.
Every single Go user we had a chance to ask was adamant that we should not change the
language for better error handling.
Many mentioned that the lack of specific error handling support in Go is most apparent
when coming freshly from another language that has that support.
As one becomes more fluent and writes more idiomatic Go code, the issue becomes much less important.
This is of course not a sufficiently large set of people to be representative,
but it may be a different set of people than we see on GitHub, and their feedback serves as yet another data point.Of course, there are also valid arguments in favor of change:Lack of better error handling support remains the top complaint in our user surveys.
If the Go team really does take user feedback seriously, we ought to do something about this eventually.
(Although there does not seem to be
overwhelming support
for a language change either.)Perhaps the singular focus on reducing the character count is misguided.
A better approach might be to make default error handling highly visible with a keyword
while still removing boilerplate ().
Such an approach might make it easier for a reader (a code reviewer!) to see that an error
is handled, without “looking twice”, resulting in improved code quality and safety.
This would bring us back to the beginnings of  and .We don’t really know how much the issue is the straightforward syntactic verbosity of
error checking, versus the verbosity of good error handling:
constructing errors that are a useful part of an API and meaningful to developers and
end-users alike.
This is something we’d like to study in greater depth.Still, no attempt to address error handling so far has gained sufficient traction.
If we are honestly taking stock of where we are, we can only admit that we
neither have a shared understanding of the problem,
nor do we all agree that there is a problem in the first place.
With this in mind, we are making the following pragmatic decision:For the foreseeable future, the Go team will stop pursuing syntactic language changes
for error handling.
We will also close all open and incoming proposals that concern themselves primarily
with the syntax of error handling, without further investigation.The community has put tremendous effort into exploring, discussing, and debating these issues.
While this may not have resulted in any changes to error handling syntax, these efforts have
resulted in many other improvements to the Go language and our processes.
Maybe, at some point in the future, a clearer picture will emerge on error handling.
Until then, we look forward to focusing this incredible passion on new opportunities
to make Go better for everyone.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux User Share Hits a Multi-Year High On Steam For May 2025</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/06/02/2124213/linux-user-share-hits-a-multi-year-high-on-steam-for-may-2025?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Mon, 2 Jun 2025 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Linux user share on Steam rose to 2.69% in May 2025 -- the highest level recorded since at least 2018.

Research suggests that these Ice Age Britons weren't eating human flesh out of necessity but as part of a ritual. But how certain can we be? And could we really be looking at an ancient crime scene?

Join Tristan Hughes host of The Ancients and the team at the Natural History Museum, London in this new film as they reveal the incredible story of the discovery of the Gough's Cave Cannibals.  

Now on display at the Natural History Museum in London, a team of experts including Dr Selina Brace and William Marsh are leading a project to help finally discover just who these people were and perhaps more chillingly, who they were eating.

Huge thanks to the Natural History Museum London as well as the Longleat Estate, Cheddar Gorge & Caves for providing access to these unique artefacts. 

Why not go and see these artefacts for yourself? More information about the exhibition can be found here: https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/the-cannibals-of-goughs-cave.html

A frozen desert larger than Europe, lying atop a sheet containing more than 90% of the world’s ice. But buried beneath this frosty surface, lie fossils and relics from an age where Antarctica was wildly different- covered not by ice, but by forests of trees. 

Today, we will relive that story as we unravel the continent’s rich history; how it transformed from an oasis of life, into the largest desert on the planet, Antarctica.

availability of Gateway API v1.3.0! We are
also pleased to announce that there are already a number of conformant
implementations to try, made possible by postponing this blog
announcement. Version 1.3.0 of the API was released about a month ago on
April 24, 2025.Gateway API v1.3.0 brings a new feature to the  channel
(Gateway API's GA release channel): percentage-based request mirroring, and
introduces three new experimental features: cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)
filters, a standardized mechanism for listener and gateway merging, and retry
budgets.Graduation to Standard channelGraduation to the Standard channel is a notable achievement for Gateway API
features, as inclusion in the Standard release channel denotes a high level of
confidence in the API surface and provides guarantees of backward compatibility.
Of course, as with any other Kubernetes API, Standard channel features can continue
to evolve with backward-compatible additions over time, and we (SIG Network)
certainly expect
further refinements and improvements in the future. For more information on how
all of this works, refer to the Gateway API Versioning Policy.Percentage-based request mirroringPercentage-based request mirroring is an enhancement to the
existing support for HTTP request mirroring, which allows HTTP requests to be duplicated to another backend using the
RequestMirror filter type. Request mirroring is particularly useful in
blue-green deployment. It can be used to assess the impact of request scaling on
application performance without impacting responses to clients.The previous mirroring capability worked on all the requests to a .
Percentage-based request mirroring allows users to specify a subset of requests
they want to be mirrored, either by percentage or fraction. This can be
particularly useful when services are receiving a large volume of requests.
Instead of mirroring all of those requests, this new feature can be used to
mirror a smaller subset of them.Here's an example with 42% of the requests to "foo-v1" being mirrored to "foo-v2":You can also configure the partial mirroring using a fraction. Here is an example
with 5 out of every 1000 requests to "foo-v1" being mirrored to "foo-v2".Additions to Experimental channelThe Experimental channel is Gateway API's channel for experimenting with new
features and gaining confidence with them before allowing them to graduate to
standard. Please note: the experimental channel may include features that are
changed or removed later.Starting in release v1.3.0, in an effort to distinguish Experimental channel
resources from Standard channel resources, any new experimental API kinds have the
prefix "". For the same reason, experimental resources are now added to the
API group gateway.networking.x-k8s.io instead of gateway.networking.k8s.io.
Bear in mind that using new experimental channel resources means they can coexist
with standard channel resources, but migrating these resources to the standard
channel will require recreating them with the standard channel names and API
group (both of which lack the "x-k8s" designator or "X" prefix).The v1.3 release introduces two new experimental API kinds: XBackendTrafficPolicy
and XListenerSet. To be able to use experimental API kinds, you need to install
the Experimental channel Gateway API YAMLs from the locations listed below.Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows
a web page to access restricted resources from a server on an origin (domain,
scheme, or port) different from the domain that served the web page. This feature
adds a new HTTPRoute  type, called "CORS", to configure the handling of
cross-origin requests before the response is sent back to the client.Here's an example of a simple cross-origin configuration:In this case, the Gateway returns an  of "*", which means that the
requested resource can be referenced from any origin, a 
(Access-Control-Allow-Methods) that permits the , , and 
verbs, and a  allowing , ,
, , and .The complete list of fields in the new CORS filter:XListenerSets (standardized mechanism for Listener and Gateway merging)This release adds a new experimental API kind, XListenerSet, that allows a
shared list of  to be attached to one or more parent Gateway(s). In
addition, it expands upon the existing suggestion that Gateway API implementations
may merge configuration from multiple Gateway objects. It also:adds a new field  to the  of a Gateway. The
 field defines from which Namespaces to select XListenerSets
that are allowed to attach to that Gateway: Same, All, None, or Selector based.increases the previous maximum number (64) of listeners with the addition of
XListenerSets.allows the delegation of listener configuration, such as TLS, to applications in
other namespaces.The following example shows a Gateway with an HTTP listener and two child HTTPS
XListenerSets with unique hostnames and certificates. The combined set of listeners
attached to the Gateway includes the two additional HTTPS listeners in the
XListenerSets that attach to the Gateway. This example illustrates the
delegation of listener TLS config to application owners in different namespaces
("store" and "app"). The HTTPRoute has both the Gateway listener named "foo" and
one XListenerSet listener named "second" as .Each listener in a Gateway must have a unique combination of , ,
(and  if supported by the protocol) in order for all listeners to be
 and not conflicted over which traffic they should receive.Furthermore, implementations can  separate Gateways into a single set of
listener addresses if all listeners across those Gateways are compatible. The
management of merged listeners was under-specified in releases prior to v1.3.0.With the new feature, the specification on merging is expanded. Implementations
must treat the parent Gateways as having the merged list of all listeners from
itself and from attached XListenerSets, and validation of this list of listeners
must behave the same as if the list were part of a single Gateway. Within a single
Gateway, listeners are ordered using the following precedence:Single Listeners (not a part of an XListenerSet) first,Remaining listeners ordered by:
object creation time (oldest first), and if two listeners are defined in
objects that have the same timestamp, thenalphabetically based on "{namespace}/{name of listener}"Retry budgets (XBackendTrafficPolicy)This feature allows you to configure a  across all endpoints
of a destination Service. This is used to limit additional client-side retries
after reaching a configured threshold. When configuring the budget, the maximum
percentage of active requests that may consist of retries may be specified, as well as
the interval over which requests will be considered when calculating the threshold
for retries. The development of this specification changed the existing
experimental API kind BackendLBPolicy into a new experimental API kind,
XBackendTrafficPolicy, in the interest of reducing the proliferation of policy
resources that had commonalities.The following example shows an XBackendTrafficPolicy that applies a
 that represents a budget that limits the retries to a maximum
of 20% of requests, over a duration of 10 seconds, and to a minimum of 3 retries
over 1 second.Unlike other Kubernetes APIs, you don't need to upgrade to the latest version of
Kubernetes to get the latest version of Gateway API. As long as you're running
Kubernetes 1.26 or later, you'll be able to get up and running with this version
of Gateway API.To try out the API, follow the Getting Started Guide.
As of this writing, four implementations are already conformant with Gateway API
v1.3 experimental channel features. In alphabetical order:Wondering when a feature will be added? There are lots of opportunities to get
involved and help define the future of Kubernetes routing APIs for both ingress
and service mesh.The maintainers would like to thank  who's contributed to Gateway
API, whether in the form of commits to the repo, discussion, ideas, or general
support. We could never have made this kind of progress without the support of
this dedicated and active community.Related Kubernetes blog articles]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>New Moderate Linux Flaw Allows Password Hash Theft Via Core Dumps in Ubuntu, RHEL, Fedora</title><link>https://it.slashdot.org/story/25/06/02/0140228/new-moderate-linux-flaw-allows-password-hash-theft-via-core-dumps-in-ubuntu-rhel-fedora?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Mon, 2 Jun 2025 04:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An anonymous reader shared this report from The Hacker News:

Two information disclosure flaws have been identified in apport and systemd-coredump, the core dump handlers in Ubuntu, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and Fedora, according to the Qualys Threat Research Unit (TRU). 

Tracked as CVE-2025-5054 and CVE-2025-4598, both vulnerabilities are race condition bugs that could enable a local attacker to obtain access to access sensitive information. Tools like Apport and systemd-coredump are designed to handle crash reporting and core dumps in Linux systems. "These race conditions allow a local attacker to exploit a SUID program and gain read access to the resulting core dump," Saeed Abbasi, manager of product at Qualys TRU, said... 
Red Hat said CVE-2025-4598 has been rated Moderate in severity owing to the high complexity in pulling an exploit for the vulnerability, noting that the attacker has to first win the race condition and be in possession of an unprivileged local account... Qualys has also developed proof-of-concept code for both vulnerabilities, demonstrating how a local attacker can exploit the coredump of a crashed unix_chkpwd process, which is used to verify the validity of a user's password, to obtain password hashes from the /etc/shadow file. 
Advisories were also issued by Gentoo, Amazon Linux, and Debian, the article points out. (Though "It's worth noting that Debian systems aren't susceptible to CVE-2025-4598 by default, since they don't include any core dump handler unless the systemd-coredump package is manually installed.") 

Canonical software security engineer Octavio Galland explains the issue on Canonical's blog. "If a local attacker manages to induce a crash in a privileged process and quickly replaces it with another one with the same process ID that resides inside a mount and pid namespace, apport will attempt to forward the core dump (which might contain sensitive information belonging to the original, privileged process) into the namespace... In order to successfully carry out the exploit, an attacker must have permissions to create user, mount and pid namespaces with full capabilities."

Canonical's security team has released updates for the apport package for all affected Ubuntu releases... We recommend you upgrade all packages... The unattended-upgrades feature is enabled by default for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS onwards. This service: 

- Applies new security updates every 24 hours automatically.
- If you have this enabled, the patches above will be automatically applied within 24 hours of being available.

Why did the star lot of the spring season, a bronze head by the master sculptor Alberto Giacometti, fail to sell at Sotheby’s?

Alberto Giacometti’s 1955 bust, “Grande tête mince" (“Big Thin Head”), carried a pre-sale estimate of $70 million in Sotheby’s Modern evening auction. The auctioneer started the bidding at $59 million dollars. But no one bid - the piece went unsold.  It was the second high-profile lot to disappoint in two days. Andy Warhol’s “Big Electric Chair” (1967-68) was withdrawn from Christie’s 20th century evening auction the day before. 

Is the fine art market in trouble?

Millions were suffering under catastrophic economic conditions, so dating wasn’t really on anyone’s mind. In fact, as a result of all the turmoil and strife, sexual attitudes of the era changed dramatically in some surprising ways, and not always for the better.

Hidden away since his death in 1982, they are part of an extraordinary archive of documents and personal photographs from the frontline of history, revealing a typical, shocking life from a generation that lived through one of the darkest periods in human history.

Born in central Germany in 1888. Wilhelm studied to become a teacher, but like so many of his generation, was called to serve in the First World War.

From 1914 to 1918 he saw action on the western front, where he experienced the horrors of trench warfare and endured the loss of some of his closest friends. 

Unlike many of his comrades, Wilhelm survived the war but returned to a defeated nation in the grips of political turmoil

Wilhelm would play no part in the violent political battles of the early 1920s and instead would return to the classroom - but the coming of the great depression and the rise to power of the Nazis - would alter the course of his life and history forever.

I’ve built spam prevention for corporate and personal e-mail, moderated open-source mailing lists and IRC channels, worked at a couple social media networks, and help moderate a Mastodon instance for a few hundred people. In the last few years I’ve wasted more time fighting blog comment spam, and I’m pretty sure Large Language Models (LLMs) are to blame.I think of spam as a space with multiple equilibria. Producing spam takes work. Spammers are willing to invest that work because each message has a small chance to make money, or achieve political or emotional goals. Some spam, like the endless identical Viagra scams in my email spam folder, or the PHPBB comment spam I filter out here on aphyr.com, is cheap to generate and easy to catch. I assume the spammers make it up in volume. Other spam, like spear phishing attacks, is highly time-consuming: the spammer must identify a target, carefully craft a plausible message using, say, the identity of the target’s co-workers, or construct a facade of a bank’s log-in page, and so on. This kind of spam is more likely to make it through filters, but because it takes a lot of human work, is generally only worth it for high-value targets.LLMs seem to be changing these equilibria. Over the last year I’ve seen a new class of comment spam, using what I’m fairly sure is LLM-generated text. These comments make specific, plausible remarks about the contents of posts and images, and work in a link to some web site or mention a product. Take this one I caught a few months back:"Walking down a sidewalk lined with vibrant flowers is one of life’s simple joys! It reminds me of playing the [link redacted] slope game, where you have to navigate through colorful landscapes while dodging obstacles.Before 2023, you’d likely have paid a human a few cents to write and post that. Now, thanks to LLMs, this sort of thing is trivially automated. The model will happily fabricate relatable personal experiences in service of a spam campaign:That photo reminds me of the first time I tried macro photography in my backyard. I spent an hour trying to get a clear shot of a red flower, experimenting with angles and lighting. It was so much fun discovering the little details up close! If you ever need a break from photography, I recommend playing Snow Rider 3D for a bit of quick, light-hearted fun.Other spam seems to glue together LLM remarks with what I think is a hand-written snippet of ad copy. Note the abrupt shift in grammar, diction, and specificity.This piece masterfully blends technical depth with mythological storytelling, transforming a standard Haskell programming interview into an epic narrative. It cleverly critiques the complexity and absurdity of some technical interviews by illustrating how type-level Haskell can be pushed to esoteric extremes beautiful, powerful, and largely impractical. A fascinating and relevant read for anyone interested in the intersection of programming, language design, and narrative. I’m James Maicle, working at Cryptoairhub where we run a clear and insightful crypto blog. I’ll be bookmarking your site and following the updates. Glad to see so much valuable information shared here looking forward to exploring more strategies together. Thanks for sharing. If you interest about Crypto please visit my website and read my article [link redacted] Crypto Blog.The same thing is happening on aggregators like Hacker News, where commenters post more-or-less-obviously LLM output for… I’m not sure, exactly. Karma? Weirder still are bots like Hacker Briefs, which I suspect use an LLM to summarize trending HN posts. Here’s its summary of a recent article I wrote:“Jepsen: Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 17.4”New multi-AZ clusters in Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL offer better failure recovery but may return outdated data when reading after writes. Caution is needed.This is a totally plausible summary of the article, and it is utterly, laughably wrong. Multi-AZ clusters are not new, and they do not return outdated data when reading after writes. As the abstract succinctly explains, they allow Long Fork, a different anomaly which does not involve real-time orders at all. The bot ignored the actual problem and invented a different one. This sort of spam isn’t obviously motivated by commercial interest, but it is nevertheless depressing: one more drop in the misinformation slurry.Of course this is not news. Product reviews are inundated with LLM slop, as are social media networks. LLMs allow for cheap, fast, and automated generation of unique spam which is difficult for machines and humans to identify. The cost falls on me and other moderators, who must sift through LLM bullshit trying to sieve “awkward but sincere human” from “automated attack”. Thanks to OpenAI et al I read more spam, and each message takes longer to check.This problem is only going to get worse as LLMs improve and spammers develop more sophisticated ways to use them. In recent weeks I’ve received vague voice messages from strangers with uncanny speech patterns just asking to catch up—a sentence which, had I uttered it prior to 2023, would have been reasonably interpreted as a sign of psychosis. I assume these too are LLM-generated scams, perhaps a pig butchering scheme. So far these are from strangers, but it’s not hard to imagine an attacker using text and voice synthesis to impersonate a friend, colleague, or lover in a detailed conversation. Or one’s doctor, or bank.As the cost of generating slop decreases, it’s easy to imagine LLMs generating personae, correspondence, even months-long relationships with real humans before being deployed for commercial or political purposes. Creating plausible accounts and selling them has been a successful business model in social media for some time; likewise, we have strong clues that LLMs are already used for social media bots. Social networks have responded to these attacks via out-of-band mechanisms: IP reputation analysis, javascript and mobile app fingerprinting, statistical correlation across multiple accounts, and so on. I’m not sure how to translate these defenses to less centralized and more privacy-oriented networks, like email or blog spam. I strongly suspect the only reason Mastodon hasn’t been eaten alive by LLM spambots is because we’re just not big enough to be lucrative. But those economics are shifting, and even obscure ecological niches can be worth filling.As a moderator, that keeps me up at night.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2329 - Ehsan Ahmad</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/RNJ82qpiZME?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 17:00:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ehsan Ahmad is a comedian and co-host of "The Solid Show" with Deric Poston.

China just achieved something that could make hacking obsolete forever - or destroy all digital privacy as we know it. Using a tiny satellite and the mysterious principles of quantum physics, Chinese scientists claim to have created truly "unhackable" encryption that even the most advanced computers can't break. But beneath the hype lies a complex reality that could either usher in an era of perfect digital security or spell the end of secrets entirely. In this video, we explore how quantum satellites are reshaping the future of communication and whether this revolutionary technology will protect us or expose us all.

The awkward early teenage years makes everyone feel self-conscious, like an outsider, whether it's an embarrassing pimple or your arms being permanently locked in a stiff T-pose. To A T, a narrative adventure from Katamari Damacy creator Keita Takahashi, is a sweet-natured fable about growing up and accepting yourself. But while the narrative and world you occupy are cute and quirky, the act of playing never feels as playful as it should.You play as a created character accompanied by your faithful canine companion, both of whom you grant personalized names at the start. Your arms are permanently stretched outward, stiff as a board, for reasons that you don't fully understand. But you've made the best of it, learning to adapt with special tools like an extra-long spoon to eat your breakfast cereal. You can turn sideways to shimmy your way through doors. And your dog is apparently well-trained enough to help you change clothes or use the bathroom.Naturally, this quality makes you an outsider. Everything you do is just slightly awkward and harder than it should be, and you're bullied relentlessly by the other kids at your school. The writing is very sharp in capturing both the inherent silliness of schoolyard teasing and the way it can have a real impact on your mental health, making you preoccupied with the taunting even when the bullies aren't around. Your avatar is just a happy, friendly kid who loves his favorite cereal mascot, tries to do well in school and at sports, and just wants to fit in.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Anti-Vaxxers Get their Own Island?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Aj7rJ1xv8HI</link><author>StarTalk</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Aj7rJ1xv8HI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 15:30:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoAEDirJPjEUFcF2FklnBA">StarTalk</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Check out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus

Behind the scenes, one technology powers these seamless interactions: .Unlike traditional request-response models, WebSockets enable full-duplex, low-latency communication over a single persistent connection. This makes them the ideal choice when both the client and server need to exchange data continuously and without delay.In this article, we’ll explore the top 10 real-world use cases of WebSockets, many of which are also relevant for . Each use case includes a simplified system design overview. To stay focused on WebSockets, we'll cover only the components involved in enabling real-time features rather than the full end-to-end system.In real-time chat applications, users expect —whether it's new messages, typing indicators, delivery receipts, or presence status.But delivering this seamless experience at scale is , especially with  and thousands of concurrent group chats. the server every few seconds to check for new messages isn’t efficient due to: Wasted bandwidth when no new data is availableServer overload, as every client repeatedly hits the backend solve this by maintaining a persistent, full-duplex connection between client and server, enabling:Real-time typing and presence updatesA single connection for sending and receiving, eliminating repeated HTTP overhead: Maintains persistent connections with clients, handles incoming events and messages, and delivers real-time updates to users.: Keeps track of active WebSocket sessions and maps users to their current connections.: Temporarily buffers incoming messages for asynchronous processing, enabling system decoupling and ensuring reliable persistence.: Consumes messages from the queue, attaches relevant metadata, and stores them in the message database.: A durable and scalable database that holds all messages, metadata, and conversation history.1. Client Establishes WebSocket ConnectionWhen a user opens the app:The client authenticates with the backend using a Then establishes a  to a chat server:{
  "action": "connect",
  "userId": "user-123",
  "device": "ios"
}This connection remains open for the entire sessionWhen the user sends a message:The client sends it over the WebSocket connection:{
  "type": "message",
  "conversationId": "conv-456",
  "from": "user-123",
  "to": "user-789",
  "text": "Hey! How’s it going?",
  "timestamp": 1716601000
}Pushes it to a The chat server checks the  to find active WebSocket sessionsIf the user is online, the message is pushed instantly:{
  "type": "incoming_message",
  "conversationId": "conv-456",
  "from": "user-123",
  "text": "Hey! How’s it going?",
  "timestamp": 1716601000
}The message is stored for delivery upon reconnectOr sent as a The same WebSocket connection used for messaging can also be leveraged to send  like typing indicators and presence status.When a user begins typing in a conversation:The client sends a lightweight event over the open WebSocket connection:{
  "type": "typing",
  "conversationId": "conv-456",
  "userId": "user-123"
}The server receives the event and checks the  to determine if the recipient(s) are currently online.If they are online, the typing event is  to their active WebSocket sessions.If they are offline, the event is discarded (not stored), since it's ephemeral and has no long-term value.Typing events are typically throttled (e.g., once every few seconds) to avoid flooding the system.In fast-paced online multiplayer games, every millisecond matters.  across all playersIf you rely on HTTP polling where clients keep asking the server for updates, you introduce:: Updates arrive late.: One player sees a different state than another.: Too many requests = stressed servers. allow game clients and servers to send frequent updates (player positions, moves, game events) in both directions. This keeps all players’ views in sync during gameplay.Maintain persistent, low-latency connections with players to send and receive real-time game events.Tracks which players are connected, which match they belong to, and which WebSocket server is managing their session.Runs the core game logic including input processing, physics, and rules. Ensures a consistent, authoritative game state.Holds the live, up-to-date snapshot of all game entities (e.g., players, objects, projectiles) for a specific match, updated on every game tick.Each active game instance (e.g., match, room, arena) is represented as a  identified by a session ID.2. Client Input StreamingThe client establishes a persistent WebSocket connection to one of the WebSocket servers.Sends a  message with its  and session info:{
  "action": "join",
  "playerId": "p789",
  "session": "arena:1234"
}From that point on, the client streams user input events (movement, actions, abilities) every :{
  "type": "input",
  "playerId": "p789",
  "input": {
    "moveX": 1,
    "moveY": 0,
    "shoot": true
  },
  "timestamp": 1716600000
}This approach ensures the server receives a continuous stream of player actions in real-time.3. Game Match Server and State PropagationEach session is managed by an authoritative Game Match Server that runs a  at a fixed tick rate—typically .On each tick, the server:Collects and queues all input events received from connected playersProcesses core game logic, including:Movement and velocity updatesHealth and damage calculationsApplies physics and collision detectionUpdates the in-memory game stateComputes a  and sends it to all WebSocket servers managing players in that session:{
  "type": "stateUpdate",
  "tick": 1441,
  "players": [
    { "id": "p789", "x": 55, "y": 89, "health": 92 },

  ],
  "bullets": [...],
  "timestamp": 1716600012
}WebSocket nodes forward these updates to the connected clients.Clients use these updates to  and .With efficient engineering practices such as: and  (e.g., Node.js, Netty) (e.g., quadtrees or grid-based zoning) to broadcast updates only to nearby players to reduce payload size...a single WebSocket server can support thousands of concurrent players across multiple game sessions with .On modern social media platforms, users expect to see new posts, likes, comments, and alerts the moment they happen.But without a real-time mechanism, the client must constantly poll the server every few seconds to check for updates. This results in:High latency for the user (delayed updates)Unnecessary load on servers and wasted bandwidth enable servers to push these updates instantaneously to connected clients, creating a live feed experience.To support millions of concurrent users, platforms implement:Dedicated WebSocket Servers to manage persistent connections via load balancers (ensuring a user reconnects to the same server)Event Source (Like/Comment): Captures user interactions (e.g., likes, comments, follows) and generates structured events.Buffers and routes events asynchronously to downstream services for processing (e.g., Kafka, Redis Streams).Consumes events from the queue, determines target users, and routes updates to the appropriate WebSocket servers.Maintain persistent client connections and deliver real-time feed updates to online users.Tracks which users are connected and maps them to their corresponding WebSocket server nodes.Each user is assigned a dedicated feed and notification channel, enabling personalized real-time updates. – main activity feed – direct notifications (likes, comments, follows)The system may also support shared or topic-based channels: – AI-related posts – tech hashtag activity – group or community feed2. WebSocket Connection & Subscription FlowWhen a user opens the app:The client establishes a  to the WebSocket Gateway.After authentication, it sends a  message to specify its feed channels:{
  "action": "subscribe",
  "channels": [
    "feed:user:alice",
    "notifications:user:alice"
  ]
}The WebSocket server registers these channel subscriptions in a , typically in an in-memory registry or a distributed cache (e.g., Redis).3. Event Generation & PushWhen a new event occurs such as a comment on a user’s post:The backend service (e.g., ) emits the event:{
  "event": "new_comment",
  "postId": "abc123",
  "commentId": "xyz789",

You will find references at the bottom of this page if you want to go deeper.Once upon a time, there lived a software engineering student named Maya.She worked as a freelancer part-time.Although she had many customers, the platform fee was extremely high.One day, she decided to build a freelancer site with fair pricing.And her tiny site became popular in a short time.So she set up a microservices architecture for scalability.Yet she didn’t know much about architectural design patterns.And set up separate public URLs for each microservice.The client talked directly to different microservices based on the task.This means tight coupling and increased client complexity.Also many users accessed her site on their mobile. Yet she sent the same amount of information to the desktop and mobile users.And this worsened the latency and bandwidth usage.So she set up an API Gateway.Imagine the  as a hotel receptionist who checks a user’s reservation and gives them room keys.It let her move the non-business logic, such as authorization, into a separate service.Code reviews are critical but time-consuming. CodeRabbit acts as your AI co-pilot, giving you instant code review comments and the potential impact of each pull request.Besides, CodeRabbit provides one-click fix suggestions. It also lets you define custom code quality rules using AST Grep patterns and catch subtle issues that traditional static analysis tools might miss.CodeRabbit has reviewed over 10 million PRs; it's installed on 1 million repositories, and 70k+ open-source projects use it. CodeRabbit is free for all open-source repos.Logical errors (incorrect conditions, miscalculations)Common pitfalls (off-by-one, infinite loops)Concurrency issues (data races, deadlocks)Security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF)Code smells (duplication, lengthy methods)Best practices violations (SOLID, DRY, KISS)Complexity issues (time & space inefficiencies)Weak error handling (especially external calls)Maintainability & readability concernsWriting clean, secure, and performant code is tough. CodeRabbit makes it easy.The API Gateway acts as a single entry point for the site.The client sends the request over HTTPS for security.Yet it has to be decrypted, and this takes extra processing power on each server.So the API Gateway does . This means decrypting traffic before forwarding it to microservices, thus reducing server load.Here’s how the API Gateway routes the request:The client sends the request to the API GatewayIt then checks if the client is allowed to make the requestThe API Gateway validates the request’s header and body against the schema. Also transform the request if necessaryIt routes the request to the correct microservices. It handles routing based on the request’s URL path, HTTP headers, method, or query parametersThe API Gateway then combines the responses from different microservicesIt responds to the client and caches the response for future requests if neededAlso it finds the device type, such as desktop or mobile, from HTTP headers to route the request accordingly. This approach simplifies the client logic and improves latency.Besides the API Gateway prevents overloading of unhealthy servers by pausing repeated failing requests. This technique is called the .Although the API Gateway simplifies client interactions, it introduces a set of problems.It increases latency as there’s an extra network hopIt increases costs and operational complexity because of maintenance effortsIt might become a performance bottleneck when there’s high trafficAlso it could become a  if set up incorrectly. So it’s necessary to install more instances of the API Gateway for high availability.Some popular ways to set up an API Gateway are using Nginx, Kong, or Tyk.A popular variant of the API Gateway is the backend for frontend () pattern. It means a separate API Gateway for each device type—desktop and mobile.While the API Gateway pattern offers many benefits, it’s important to use it carefully. Otherwise it’ll add more complexity than value.Subscribe to get simplified case studies delivered straight to your inbox:Want to advertise in this newsletter? 📰Thank you for supporting this newsletter.

There are weeds breaking through cracks in its rotting floorboards, the room in the east wing that Gideon Ofnir once used as an office is now an abandoned mess of dust and clutter, and sunlight is bleeding through a gaping hole in the stone wall where the giant pair of fingers previously resided. It's a familiar space, but one that's also noteworthy for its differences, which feels reflective of Elden Ring Nightreign as a whole. Anyone who's played Elden Ring will recognize Roundtable Hold and enemies like the Bell Bearing Hunter and Ancient Hero of Zamor. Nightreign's combat mechanics are almost identical, too, making it easy to fall into a habitual groove as you roll through attacks and strike back with a vengeance. Elden Ring's DNA is ever-present, but Nightreign is also a game of striking subversions: a From Software game that asks you to play it unconventionally, disregarding meticulous exploration, isolation, and measured combat for a cooperative multiplayer game built on speed and aggression. In many ways, it's the antithesis of what people typically come to From Software games for, and yet somehow, someway, this experimental non-sequel is an absolute triumph.It all starts with Nightreign's enticing structure. First, you choose the boss you want to fight, then embark on a 35- to 45-minute Expedition that takes place across three in-game days. During the day, you and two teammates (doing multiplayer is the ideal scenario) will quickly explore the land of Limveld, an alternate version of Elden Ring's Limgrave where the topography stays the same but locations and enemies randomly change from one Expedition to the next. Everyone starts at Level 1, so you'll want to kill enemies to accrue runes and level up, as well as find new weapons, tools, and character upgrades to aid you in the battles ahead.At some point during both the first and second days, a deadly battle-royale-style circle begins closing in, funneling you into a mandatory showdown against a random boss. These bosses are selected from a pool of familiar foes, so there's a lot of variety, but you'll also run into the same few opponents if you're repeating the same Expedition over and over again. If you manage to survive for two days and defeat the boss at the end of Day 2, you'll move onto the third day and square off against the Night Lord you chose to fight at the beginning of the Expedition in what is typically a grandiose, challenging, and ultimately thrilling battle. Whether you win or lose, you'll earn relics that you can equip to provide various advantages in future Expeditions, from adding elemental damage that targets a boss's weakness to improvements to attributes like strength and vigor.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Bliki: Say Your Writing</title><link>https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SayYourWriting.html</link><author>Martin Fowler</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 13:50:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://martinfowler.com/feed.atom">Dev - Martin Fowler</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Here's one of the best tips I know for writers, which was told to me by
  Bruce Eckel.Once you've got a reasonable draft, read it out loud. By doing this you'll
  find bits that don't sound right, and need to fix. Interestingly, you don't
  actually have to vocalize (thus making a noise) but your lips have to
  move.
This advice is for those who, like me, strive to get a conversational tone
  to their writings. A lot of people are taught to write in a different way
  than they speak, but I find prose much more engaging with this conversational
  tone. I imagine I'm sitting in pub, explaining the concepts to my companions.
  I've heard people say that when reading my work, they can hear me speaking it
  - which is exactly the effect I'm after. Too often I read prose that feels flabby. Two kinds of flab stand out:
  corporate prose and academic prose. I often tell people that if they read
  their prose and it sounds like it could have come from Accenture 

, then they are doing it wrong. And, of course, the passive
  voice is rarely preferred. Speaking makes this flab noticeable, so we can cut
  it out.In my case I find I constantly (silently) speak the words as I'm writing.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux 6.16 Adds &apos;X86_NATIVE_CPU&apos; Option To Optimize Your Kernel Build</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/05/27/2223207/linux-616-adds-x86nativecpu-option-to-optimize-your-kernel-build?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 01:25:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[unixbhaskar shares a report from Phoronix: The X86_NATIVE_CPU Kconfig build time option has been merged for the Linux 6.16 merge window as an easy means of enforcing "-march=native" compiler behavior on AMD and Intel processors to optimize your kernel build for the local CPU architecture/family of your system. For those wanting to "-march=native" your Linux kernel build on AMD/Intel x86_64 processors, the new CONFIG_X86_NATIVE_CPU option can be easily enabled for setting that compiler option on your local kernel builds.
 
The CONFIG_X86_NATIVE_CPU option is honored if compiling the Linux x86_64 kernel with GCC or LLVM Clang when using Clang 19 or newer due to a compiler bug with the Linux kernel on older compiler versions. In addition to setting the "-march=native" compiler option for the Linux kernel C code, enabling this new Kconfig build option also sets "-Ctarget-cpu=native" for the kernel's Rust code too. 






 "It seems interesting though," comments unixbhaskar. "If the detailed benchmark shows some improvement with the option selected, then distros might start to adopt it for their flavor."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Did Genghis Khan Change the World?</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/how-did-genghis-khan-change-the-world</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/68308f34e57506ea97ef8152/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=CgFeRx6CfuYf9Zc83xmR6SIpv8geEwtzK2nkCLqdgdY" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 23:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Entry-level tech jobs are getting wiped out (News)</title><link>https://changelog.com/news/146</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/news/146/changelog-news-146.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 21:15:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The San Fransisco Standard published some sobering news for new graduates, the Forge team decided to put an AI agent in your shell, Fernando Borretti says you can choose tools that make you happy, Jujutsu’s flexibility and safety changed Nathan Witmer’s approach to version control, Anil Dash is as excited about MCP as almost everyone else is & Alex Kladov shares two rules of thumb around pushing “ifs” up and “fors” down.Changelog++ members save 1 minute on this episode because they made the ads disappear.
