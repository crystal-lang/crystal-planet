Details are in this issue. I originally kept it on RESP2 because, at the time, nothing was using RESP3. Even the modules owned by Redis Labs (now just called Redis, Inc) were still outputting RESP2 data types.The downside is that it’s a pretty breaking change, which is difficult for something like Redis where most applications aren’t using it directly and are instead using it through shards like  and . Both of those shards do dependency management well and would avoid this breaking change until they were ready to upgrade, but others might not.Anyway, if anyone’s willing to take a look and offer feedback, that would be helpful.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>fast-http-server: Super fast, zero configuration command line HTTP Server</title><link>https://old.reddit.com/r/crystal_programming/comments/1rhrcu3/fasthttpserver_super_fast_zero_configuration/</link><author>/u/sdogruyol</author><category>community</category><pubDate>Sun, 1 Mar 2026 07:46:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://old.reddit.com/r/crystal_programming/">r/crystal_programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Blood Stone Pendant</title><link>https://medium.com/@nayakbarssa/blood-stone-pendant-e83657a0247d?source=rss------crystal_lang-5</link><author>effectivegems001</author><category>blog</category><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 10:05:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://medium.com/tag/crystal-lang/latest?source=rss------crystal_lang-5">Crystal Lang on Medium</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Projects that shouldn&apos;t work: doomcr</title><link>https://forum.crystal-lang.org/t/projects-that-shouldnt-work-doomcr/8740</link><author>omarluq</author><category>community</category><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 03:32:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://forum.crystal-lang.org/latest">Forum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I did a fun and useless thing: put Doom in the terminal with Crystal.

Individual specs run fine when executed separately.This issue consistently happens on macOS / Apple Silicon.Clearing the cache () does not fix the issue; it still hangs right after the Codegen/linking stage.CPU Usage: While hanging, both the  process and the compiled  binary sit at 0.0% CPU (State ). I think.. this indicates a deadlock or a blocking wait rather than an infinite loop.You can reproduce this by cloning the OWASP Noir repository and running .Architecture: Apple Silicon (ARM64)I suspect this might be a macOS-specific LLVM or spec runner issue, possibly a deadlock when the runner tries to execute the compiled spec binary. Has anyone seen this behavior before, or have any pointers on how to debug this further?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Retriggering a shards postinstall?</title><link>https://forum.crystal-lang.org/t/retriggering-a-shards-postinstall/8737</link><author>Fijxu</author><category>community</category><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 05:20:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://forum.crystal-lang.org/latest">Forum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Some tools that I use like Ameba and cr-source-typer execute a postinstall (example: cr-source-typer/shard.yml at master · Vici37/cr-source-typer · GitHub ) and will place it’s executable in the  directory of the current project, but when the system is updated, shared libraries change and then the shard binary has to be rebuilt, but shards does not seem to have an easy way to re trigger the postinstall without removing the dependency from the  file and running shards install <dependency>.There is any other way to do it?

When banks like Goldman are sitting on billions in digital assets and major exchanges are hard-coding BTC into insurance funds, we’re not in degen casino mode anymore - we’re watching a global re-banking in real time. 💎So if you’re still running a vibes-based portfolio in 2026… that’s a choice. Let’s talk about the blueprint institutions are quietly following.
  
  
  1. The Foundation: Bitcoin as Digital Granite 🪨
Bitcoin is no longer “the risky trade” — it’s the .
With most supply locked away and realized volatility sliding toward blue-chip territory, any ugly dip toward key levels is less “oh no” and more “corporate discount window”.BTC in this setup isn’t a lotto ticket. It’s reserve collateral.
  
  
  2. The Infrastructure Anchor: WBT as the Stabilizer ⚓
Everyone talks about exchanges, very few treat their native coins as .Between index inclusion and its role as a “safe harbour” asset during panic phases, WhiteBIT Coin behaves less like a meme and more like exchange equity with built-in utility.When altcoins are doing their usual +30% / –35% shuffle, this is the piece meant to bleed less, rebound cleaner and keep the portfolio from wobbling off a cliff.
  
  
  3. The Tech Leaps: ETH and LINK as the Rails 🚀
Bucket:  = your stake in the global decentralized computer. Fees, apps, rollups — it’s the execution layer of half the industry. = the “data glue” for RWAs, DeFi, and anything that needs real-world inputs to not break.If your capital is B2B-minded — infra, RWAs, payment rails — this is where you express that thesis.
  
  
  4. From Gambling to Insurance 🧠
This isn’t about predicting the next 100x ticker.
It’s about turning your holdings into a weather-proof balance sheet:ETH & LINK as growth railsIn a world of melting fiat, your crypto stack shouldn’t look like a weekend trading experiment — it should look like a corporate insurance policy that benefits from chaos instead of dying in it.If you want to see the numbers and allocation logic broken down in more detail, there’s a deeper article linked in the description.Stop playing like retail.

It tracks dependency changes at the file level and skips recompilation of files that haven’t changed. The result is that after your first compile, subsequent compiles while you’re developing should be significantly faster.It also includes WASM compilation support ( target), but the main thing I’m looking for feedback on right now is the incremental compilation experience during active development.Install (macOS only right now)
brew tap crimson-knight/crystal-alpha

brew install crystal-alpha

That’s it. This installs alongside your existing  compiler - it doesn’t replace it.It works exactly like  but the command is :
# Build your project

crystal-alpha build src/my_app.cr -o bin/my_app

# Run specs

crystal-alpha spec

# Watch mode - recompiles on file changes

crystal-alpha watch src/my_app.cr

This is where incremental compilation really shines. Instead of manually rebuilding after every change, run:
crystal-alpha watch src/my_app.cr -o bin/my_app

Watch mode uses macOS native kqueue file monitoring — it detects the moment you save a file and triggers an incremental rebuild automatically. Only the files you changed (and anything that depends on them) get recompiled. Everything else is cached.A few things that make this practical for real development: — Executes your binary after each successful compile. When you save a file, it kills the running process, recompiles, and restarts it. This is the one you want for web apps:
crystal-alpha watch src/my_app.cr -o bin/my_app --run

 — Clears the terminal before each compile so you get a clean output — Waits 300ms after a save before compiling, so rapid saves from your editor don’t cause repeated builds — If your code has an error, it prints the error and keeps watching. Fix the file, save, and it tries again immediatelyThe point of watch mode is that you leave it running in a terminal while you work. Save a file, see the result in seconds. For a project that normally takes 30+ seconds to compile from scratch, you should see incremental rebuilds in the low single digits.Go to your project directoryDo a cold compile: crystal-alpha build src/your_app.cr -o bin/my_appChange a file - any file, even just add a commentTell me how long both compiles tookYou don’t need precise benchmarks. Even just “cold compile took about 30 seconds, second compile took about 4 seconds” is exactly what I’m looking for.If you have a larger project, that’s even better. The bigger the project, the more dramatic the difference should be.: Try watch mode for a real development session. Start crystal-alpha watch src/my_app.cr -o bin/my_app --run, make some edits, and tell me what the experience feels like compared to your normal workflow.What project you tested with (rough size is fine - “small CLI tool” vs “web app with 50 models”)Cold compile time (rough is fine,  output works too)Incremental compile time after a small changeDid it produce a correct binary? (aka Does your app still work?)Any errors or weird behaviormacOS only (Apple Silicon and Intel) for nowThis is an alpha - if something breaks, I want to hear about itThe first compile will always be the same speed as normal Crystal since there’s nothing cached yetThanks for helping test this. The goal is to make Crystal development feel as fast as editing a scripting language while keeping all the performance benefits of a compiled language.14 posts - 6 participants]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Crystal (Spatik) Tortoise: Meaning, Benefits &amp; Vastu Significance</title><link>https://medium.com/@nayakbarssa/crystal-spatik-tortoise-meaning-benefits-vastu-significance-9efcd4dd59d5?source=rss------crystal_lang-5</link><author>effectivegems001</author><category>blog</category><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 08:34:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://medium.com/tag/crystal-lang/latest?source=rss------crystal_lang-5">Crystal Lang on Medium</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Crystal (Spatik) Tortoise is a powerful vastu and feng shui remedy known for attracting wealth, stability, longevity, and positive…]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Scientifically Ranking the Pokémon Crystal Trainers (2023) [video]</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6E6OaWb7LQ</link><author>aw1621107</author><category>HN</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 07:03:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/newest">Hacker News - Newest: &quot;Crystal&quot;</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Announcing Autobot - AI agent framework in Crystal</title><link>https://forum.crystal-lang.org/t/announcing-autobot-ai-agent-framework-in-crystal/8715</link><author>veelenga</author><category>community</category><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 21:11:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://forum.crystal-lang.org/latest">Forum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Crystal deserves its own AI agent framework — and it’s a perfect fit.

The rate of writing Ruby by accident from the models has also gone down a lot. I’m very grateful for these advancements!So I decided to do 2 things, that are only related by Crystal and AI.I forked  and I added some tooling to allow writing documentation for agents within a library. So now you can write docs for your peferred AI coding assistant and then pass along the skills, subagents and MCPs for that library. The  project is what I called it so that there is an easy but different command from the real , this way you can try it out without disrupting the normal shards installation. This is just for testing the idea out as my workflow improves. I think others will enjoy the level of plug-and-play that I have achieved with this.# Via Homebrew
brew tap crimson-knight/shards
brew install shards-alpha

# -- OR --

# Install from source
git clone https://github.com/crimson-knight/shards.git

cd shards
crystal build src/shards.cr -o bin/shards-alpha --release
# Copy bin/shards-alpha somewhere on your PATH or symlink it into your /local/usr/bin
# Set up Claude Code with compliance skills + agents
shards-alpha assistant init

# Use it like normal shards — everything is compatible
shards-alpha install
I went really crazy and decided to see if I could create a ralph-loop and get Claude Opus 4.6 to figure out how to implement WASM 3.0 as a compile target with garbage collection.And it works! There’s support for all kinds of features that are part of the spec, but I’m still working through linking all of the C libraries that we depend on being linked/compiled into the WASM target. This took  while running on a loop and at one point it gave up because it couldn’t figure out the path it was on. I had it think from a more first-principles perspective about it’s original architectural decisions and then it realized it had made an assumption too briefly–found the fig that worked that unlocked GC support–and it chugged away until done from there.My plan is to experiment with building full stack apps with Crystal so that I can create a mono repo, and serve the web API and the entire browser app from Crystal+Amber.What a world we live in. This is just so cool.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Crystal driving the LLM?</title><link>https://forum.crystal-lang.org/t/crystal-driving-the-llm/8713</link><author>Xen</author><category>community</category><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 17:51:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://forum.crystal-lang.org/latest">Forum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[So is anyone doing interesting stuff by letting Crystal drive the LLM?Having Gemini explain it to me, I realized that “agentic coding” is basically just giving the LLM some tools and letting it run in a feedback loop, and I guess that’s pretty much what’s driving the recent OpenClaw hoolabaloo.

Setting aside the usual (constructive) criticisms, the language is increasingly being used for serious work, and I believe greater visibility will surely help more developers to discover it.The idea: a more regular (monthly or bi-weekly) spotlight, mainly a blog article (and perhaps a short video interview on YouTube/X, remote or in-person like a podcast) showcasing projects that are either in production, well advanced, useful or simply funny/interesting.(I know, you did it in the past, like with the LavinMQ’s one, but I believe we could increase the frequency and expand to more projects)In the same initiative, we can also regularly bring core team members, as well as important contributors like:George Dietrich from AthenaSzikszai and Sijawusz from MintPaul, Jeremy and Matthew from LuckyMorgan and Marvin from MartenA semi-random example: look at termisu by Omar. The way he guides the project is genuinely fun, and the attention to detail (excellent docs, screenshots, overall developer experience) is impressive. I am genuinely curious to know how his experience with Crystal is. Don’t you either? I frequently browse recently updated Crystal repos on GitHub (like this) and keep finding real gems.What do you think? Other projects that you would like to add? Congratulations on the continuous improvements on Crystal performance. I didn’t expected it to be at  level of performance by surpassing Go and Nim. One special spotlight episode could be about LangArena and how amazingly good Crystal is performing in it. Thanks Kostya for the huge work on the benchmark! I would love to start such initiative myself and, although I have available time for it, my main challenge is economical/financial since I am recovering my small business after cancer treatment.

It’s basically a wrapper that will compile your script and cache the binary the first time it’s executed. After that, it will only replace the cached binary when the source changes.The best way to use it is with shebangs, for example lets make a simple  script#!/usr/bin/env crystalscript

puts "Hello"
Now it’s possible to call it like thisI also made it so there are different optimization mode for the binaries.For example, when I’m creating a new script, it will change often and I want the compilation to be as fast as possible. In this case I can use this shebang.#!/usr/bin/env -S crystalscript --mode dev
When I’m done I can change the mode to  (default) or  to have a faster and lighter binary.On a side note, I found a similar project called scriptisto which works with many languages, but I still wanted to try to build one myself for Crystal.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Collision reached 100,000 installations on Flathub!</title><link>https://forum.crystal-lang.org/t/collision-reached-100-000-installations-on-flathub/8704</link><author>GeopJr</author><category>community</category><pubDate>Sun, 8 Feb 2026 03:47:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://forum.crystal-lang.org/latest">Forum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As of today, my little GTK hash calculator, Collision, reached 100k installations on Flathub alone!

Manually scanning through rows of data is not only tedious but also introduces human error. This is where a specialized tool becomes essential.When you  manually, your eyes can easily skip a line, especially if you are dealing with hundreds or thousands of entries. You aren't just looking for differences; often, you need to identify duplicates within a single list or find the common ground between separate datasets. A fast, accurate, and private way to handle this is no longer a luxury—it's a necessity for efficient data work.The Challenge of Data ComparisonData rarely comes in a perfect format. Imagine you have a list of customer emails from your sales team and another list from your support ticketing system. To ensure your marketing campaign reaches the right people, you must  to see which customers are already in your pipeline and which are new prospects. Doing this in a spreadsheet can work, but it often involves complex formulas or manual sorting that eats up your time.The real need here is for a process that is: You want the answer in seconds, not minutes. The tool must reliably identify matches, differences, and duplicates. You shouldn't need to install software or sign up for a service.This is exactly the gap a high-quality online tool fills. It allows anyone, regardless of technical skill, to  and get a clear, unambiguous result.Introducing a Smarter Way to Compare Two Lists OnlineOur tool is designed to be the most straightforward method to . You don't paste your data into a black box that sends it to a server. Instead, everything happens in your browser. This client-side processing means your sensitive information—be it email addresses, product SKUs, or usernames—never leaves your computer. When you use this tool to , you are getting the benefit of advanced algorithms with the peace of mind of complete privacy.How to Use the Tool: A Simple WorkflowUsing this tool to  involves three simple steps: Paste your data into the first text area. This could be a column copied from a spreadsheet, a list from a text file, or even data typed directly. Paste your comparison data into the second text area.Choose Your Operation and Compare: Select what you want to find—differences, common values, or duplicates—and click the button to run the comparison.The tool instantly processes your request and displays the results in a clean, easy-to-copy format. Whether you need to  for unique entries or to find overlaps, the output is generated right in front of you.Key Use Cases: Where This Tool ExcelsThe ability to  is a fundamental need across various professions. Here are a few scenarios where this tool becomes indispensable:For Marketing and Sales ProfessionalsYou live in a world of lists. Email subscribers, webinar attendees, leads from a trade show, and current customers. Before sending a critical newsletter, you need to  to exclude unsubscribes or existing customers from a prospect list. This tool allows you to quickly perform a comparison to find the "new" leads that should receive your campaign, ensuring you maintain good list hygiene and improve deliverability.For Data Analysts and Project ManagersValidating data is a core part of your workflow. You might need to  of project requirements to ensure nothing was missed between the planning and execution phases. Or perhaps you have a list of IDs from a database query and need to compare it against a master list to find missing records. This tool provides a fast, reliable way to perform these checks without writing a single line of code.For Developers and IT SpecialistsWhile you can write a script to , doing so for a one-off task is overkill. When you quickly need to check configuration files, compare lists of server names, or validate user inputs, a browser-based tool is the perfect solution. Since the comparison is done client-side, you can use it with sensitive IP addresses or internal system names without worrying about data security. It’s a secure, instant utility for common data validation tasks.Beyond Simple Differences: Finding Common Ground and DuplicatesWhen we talk about the ability to , most people think only of finding what is different. However, a robust tool offers more nuanced analysis:Finding Unique Items (Symmetric Difference): This shows you the items that exist in the first list but not the second, and vice versa. It’s the classic "what's changed" comparison.Finding Common Values (Intersection): This is critical for identifying overlaps. For example, finding which customers are on both your "high-value" list and your "product launch" list. Before you even compare two separate lists, you often need to clean the data within a single list. The duplicate finder highlights repeated entries, helping you consolidate and clean your data before performing a cross-list comparison.This comprehensive functionality means you don't need to juggle multiple tools. You have one reliable place to  for any scenario.Why This Tool Is Your Best OptionThere are many ways to , from spreadsheet software to custom scripts. However, this online tool offers a unique combination of benefits:It's Truly Free and Unlimited: No hidden paywalls or limits on the number of items you can compare.It Prioritizes Your Privacy: Because the processing happens entirely in your browser, your data stays on your device. There is no upload, no server log, and no chance of your information being stored or misused. The algorithms are optimized for speed, giving you results instantly, even with large lists. The interface is clean and uncluttered, designed to let you focus on your task without distraction.When you need to , you want a solution that is fast, private, and accurate. This tool delivers on all fronts, providing a seamless experience from paste to result.Frequently Asked QuestionsHow does this tool compare two lists without uploading my data?The tool uses client-side JavaScript. When you paste your lists into the text areas, the data stays in your browser's memory. The comparison happens locally on your device, and no information is transmitted to any server. This ensures your data remains completely private and secure.What exactly happens when I click to compare two lists?The tool takes the raw text you've provided for List A and List B. It then processes these strings based on the operation you selected. If you choose to find differences, it identifies items unique to each list. If you choose to find common values, it isolates the items that appear in both. The results are then formatted and displayed on your screen instantly.Can I use this to compare two lists that are very long?Yes, the tool is designed to handle substantial amounts of data efficiently. While extreme limits are determined by your computer's memory, it can comfortably compare lists with thousands of lines. Because the processing is done locally, the speed depends on your device's processing power.Is there a difference between comparing for differences and comparing for duplicates?Yes, these are distinct operations. When you  to find differences, you are looking at the unique entries across both datasets. When you use the duplicate finder, you are analyzing a  list to find any repeated lines within it. The tool offers both functionalities to cover all your data-cleaning needs.Do I need to format my lists in a specific way?The tool treats each line in your text area as a separate item. So, if you have a list of email addresses, you should paste them with one email per line. This is the most common format when copying data from spreadsheets or text files. It keeps the process simple and intuitive.Why should I use an online tool instead of a spreadsheet to compare two lists?While spreadsheets are powerful, they often require complex formulas or multiple steps to perform a simple comparison. This dedicated tool is built for one purpose: to . It provides the answer instantly with no setup, no formulas, and no risk of making a mistake in a cell reference. It's about speed and convenience for a specific, common task.Is this compare two lists tool really free to use?Absolutely. There are no subscription fees, no hidden costs, and no limits on the number of comparisons you can perform. It is designed to be a helpful, accessible utility for anyone who needs to analyze data quickly.The next time you are faced with two columns of data, a stack of information that needs reconciling, or a simple need to find an overlap, skip the manual check. Use this fast, private, and reliable tool to  and get back to the work that really matters.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AgentKit for crystal (shard for running Agent Loops)</title><link>https://forum.crystal-lang.org/t/agentkit-for-crystal-shard-for-running-agent-loops/8697</link><author>alexkutsan</author><category>community</category><pubDate>Wed, 4 Feb 2026 10:20:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://forum.crystal-lang.org/latest">Forum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This is an LLM agent loop with support of MCP servers]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[ANN] crst - A reStructuredText (RST) parser for Crystal</title><link>https://forum.crystal-lang.org/t/ann-crst-a-restructuredtext-rst-parser-for-crystal/8696</link><author>renich</author><category>community</category><pubDate>Wed, 4 Feb 2026 09:42:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://forum.crystal-lang.org/latest">Forum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I’d like to share , a reStructuredText (RST) parser I’ve been working on.If you need to handle RST markup in Crystal; for documentation, content processing, or static sites, this shard provides a native solution that converts RST into HTML, DocBook XML, LaTeX, and plain text.Output Formats: HTML5, DocBook XML, LaTeX, Plain Text.Standard Compliance: Supports lists, tables (simple & grid), footnotes, citations, and more.Extensible: You can define custom directives and roles.Safe: Configurable safety options for file inclusion.dependencies:

This 98.8% performance improvement didn't just make developers happier—it fundamentally changed how I approach testing. 447 tests now run in  instead of —a  that makes test-driven development (TDD) practical again.
  
  
  The Problem: When Tests Become a Bottleneck
The test suite was destroying developer productivity. Every pull request meant waiting, every bug fix meant coffee breaks. With truncation-based test isolation, the team was hemorrhaging time:UserTest#test_email_validation - 
  
  
  The Root Cause: Truncation Hell
The culprit was my test isolation strategy: . Before each test, I was:Dropping and recreating data across 20+ tablesPerforming expensive I/O operations that scaled with data sizeEach test was paying a  tax just to clean up after itself. With 447 tests, that's over 3 minutes of pure overhead.
  
  
  The Solution: Transaction Rollback Strategy
Instead of physically deleting data and resetting sequences, I could simply wrap each test in a database transaction and .  transactions are designed for exactly this—atomic operations that can be discarded instantly. - Database schema loading, migrations, etc.Only test data is transactional - All changes disappear instantly -  is just a memory operation - Each test gets a fresh slate automatically
  
  
  Performance Transformation

  
  
  Dramatic Individual Test Speedup
Example: User::ValidateTest#test_email_validation
  
  
  What This Means for Developers
Before (Truncation Hell):"I'll run tests while grabbing coffee" - waiting kills productivity1.8 tests per minute - glacial feedback4+ minute feedback loop - context switching inevitable - testing becomes optionalAfter (Transaction Magic):"I'll run tests before every commit" - instant gratification9,450 tests per minute - blazing speed3-second feedback loop - you're still thinking about the code - testing becomes second nature
  
  
  The Problem: Expensive Database Surgery
Each test paid ~40-60ms of truncation overhead: 20-30ms (disk I/O) 10-15ms (catalog updates) 5-10msWith 447 tests, that's over 3 minutes of pure cleanup time.
  
  
  The Solution: Instant Rollback
Transaction rollback costs ~2-4ms per test (50-75% reduction): 1-2ms (memory allocation) 1-2ms (memory discard) Pure memory operation![IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: Prompt: Performance cost breakdown comparison chart. Left bar showing truncation costs: "TRUNCATE ops (20-30ms)" in red, "Sequence resets (10-15ms)" in orange, "Connection overhead (5-10ms)" in yellow, totaling 40-60ms per test.

Style: modern bar chart with gradient colors, clear cost labels, benchmark comparison.]Override 's  method to wrap test execution in database transactions:Setup OUTSIDE transaction - Database schema and reference data loads once per test suite - Each test runs atomically and always rolls back - Clear caches (, converted models, email collectors, )Why Override  Instead of Using Standard Hooks?The core issue is how 's  works: uses  to execute code inside a transaction blockIt sets thread-local variables to track the active transaction connectionIndividual database operations check these thread variables to reuse the transaction connectionThis pattern requires wrapping the  from the outsideStandard  lifecycle hooks have a fatal limitation, as there is no  or wrapper mechanism.By overriding , we control the  of operations and can properly use :1. Setup (OUTSIDE transaction)     ← Reference data persists
2. Begin transaction with yield
3. Test code (INSIDE transaction)  ← Thread variables track connection
4. Rollback transaction
5. Teardown (OUTSIDE transaction)  ← Clear caches, email collectors

Solution: use  for tests instead.
  
  
  Story: The Optimization and Discovery
When setting up a  application to work with , I moved all initialization instructions to  hooks:After tests were working reliably, I optimized: why run this repetitive setup for every test? If I moved it to module-level initialization, it would run once when test file loads:Tests passed initially. But when I ran with  to enable verbose output, something broke:1 crystal run /users_test.cr
Channel::ClosedError: Channel is closed
    /usr/share/crystal/src/channel.cr:142:8 in 'send'
    /usr/share/crystal/src/log/dispatch.cr:55:7 in 'dispatch'
The logging channel was closed. I reverted to  as a workaround, but I needed to understand: Why does  setup runs matter more than  it runs?
  
  
  Investigation: The Key Discovery

  
  
  Why Minitest Is Different
 doesn't run tests during normal program execution. Instead:This creates a timing problem. With module-level setup: initialize a Log instance with  on booting spawns a background fiber with a channelMain program completes →  runtime cleanup beginsChannel may be closed by garbage collection (this is where my assumption lies) fires →  runs testsTests call  → channel already closed → With , setup happens inside , so the  instance is created during shutdown, not during normal execution.
  
  
  How  Works
During shutdown, garbage collection calls , which closes the channel. But  hooks run  some cleanup, creating the race condition.The issue isn't optimization itself—it's that  isn't suitable for code that runs before . The solution is to use a dispatcher without background resources for tests:For tests with module-level init,  is ideal.The optimization itself was sound—module-level initialization  faster. The issue was incompatibility with  in a shutdown context.More broadly, any code that relies on objects with finalize methods could be affected by garbage collection events and  timing—background resources created during normal execution may be cleaned up before tests run.The fix is simple (one configuration change) but reveals a broader principle:Test infrastructure must account for shutdown order and resource cleanup timing, regardless of framework. Some libraries use  handlers for cleanup in multi-threaded applications, and when tests run after these handlers, any finalized objects (channels, connections, files, caches) become inaccessible.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Crystal talk at FOSDEM 2026</title><link>https://crystal-lang.org/2026/01/23/crystal-talk-fosdem/</link><author>Johannes Müller</author><category>official</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://crystal-lang.org/">Crystal Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The talk is going to be an introduction into some concepts of Crystals.
