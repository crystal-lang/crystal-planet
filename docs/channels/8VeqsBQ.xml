When banks like Goldman are sitting on billions in digital assets and major exchanges are hard-coding BTC into insurance funds, we’re not in degen casino mode anymore - we’re watching a global re-banking in real time. 💎So if you’re still running a vibes-based portfolio in 2026… that’s a choice. Let’s talk about the blueprint institutions are quietly following.
  
  
  1. The Foundation: Bitcoin as Digital Granite 🪨
Bitcoin is no longer “the risky trade” — it’s the .
With most supply locked away and realized volatility sliding toward blue-chip territory, any ugly dip toward key levels is less “oh no” and more “corporate discount window”.BTC in this setup isn’t a lotto ticket. It’s reserve collateral.
  
  
  2. The Infrastructure Anchor: WBT as the Stabilizer ⚓
Everyone talks about exchanges, very few treat their native coins as .Between index inclusion and its role as a “safe harbour” asset during panic phases, WhiteBIT Coin behaves less like a meme and more like exchange equity with built-in utility.When altcoins are doing their usual +30% / –35% shuffle, this is the piece meant to bleed less, rebound cleaner and keep the portfolio from wobbling off a cliff.
  
  
  3. The Tech Leaps: ETH and LINK as the Rails 🚀
Bucket:  = your stake in the global decentralized computer. Fees, apps, rollups — it’s the execution layer of half the industry. = the “data glue” for RWAs, DeFi, and anything that needs real-world inputs to not break.If your capital is B2B-minded — infra, RWAs, payment rails — this is where you express that thesis.
  
  
  4. From Gambling to Insurance 🧠
This isn’t about predicting the next 100x ticker.
It’s about turning your holdings into a weather-proof balance sheet:ETH & LINK as growth railsIn a world of melting fiat, your crypto stack shouldn’t look like a weekend trading experiment — it should look like a corporate insurance policy that benefits from chaos instead of dying in it.If you want to see the numbers and allocation logic broken down in more detail, there’s a deeper article linked in the description.Stop playing like retail. Start thinking like a treasury. 🏦🚀]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Rose Quartz Energy Bracelet – A Powerful Symbol of Love &amp; Positive Vibrations | NVC Attunements</title><link>https://dev.to/arpita_sharma_6bb05c7e981/rose-quartz-energy-bracelet-a-powerful-symbol-of-love-positive-vibrations-nvc-attunements-30fn</link><author>Arpita Sharma</author><category>blog</category><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 07:44:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/crystal">DEV Community: crystal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Rose quartz energy bracelet is a timeless piece of crystal jewelry designed to bring love, balance, and emotional healing into your life.

This 98.8% performance improvement didn't just make developers happier—it fundamentally changed how I approach testing. 447 tests now run in  instead of —a  that makes test-driven development (TDD) practical again.
  
  
  The Problem: When Tests Become a Bottleneck
The test suite was destroying developer productivity. Every pull request meant waiting, every bug fix meant coffee breaks. With truncation-based test isolation, the team was hemorrhaging time:UserTest#test_email_validation - 
  
  
  The Root Cause: Truncation Hell
The culprit was my test isolation strategy: . Before each test, I was:Dropping and recreating data across 20+ tablesPerforming expensive I/O operations that scaled with data sizeEach test was paying a  tax just to clean up after itself. With 447 tests, that's over 3 minutes of pure overhead.
  
  
  The Solution: Transaction Rollback Strategy
Instead of physically deleting data and resetting sequences, I could simply wrap each test in a database transaction and .  transactions are designed for exactly this—atomic operations that can be discarded instantly. - Database schema loading, migrations, etc.Only test data is transactional - All changes disappear instantly -  is just a memory operation - Each test gets a fresh slate automatically
  
  
  Performance Transformation

  
  
  Dramatic Individual Test Speedup
Example: User::ValidateTest#test_email_validation
  
  
  What This Means for Developers
Before (Truncation Hell):"I'll run tests while grabbing coffee" - waiting kills productivity1.8 tests per minute - glacial feedback4+ minute feedback loop - context switching inevitable - testing becomes optionalAfter (Transaction Magic):"I'll run tests before every commit" - instant gratification9,450 tests per minute - blazing speed3-second feedback loop - you're still thinking about the code - testing becomes second nature
  
  
  The Problem: Expensive Database Surgery
Each test paid ~40-60ms of truncation overhead: 20-30ms (disk I/O) 10-15ms (catalog updates) 5-10msWith 447 tests, that's over 3 minutes of pure cleanup time.
  
  
  The Solution: Instant Rollback
Transaction rollback costs ~2-4ms per test (50-75% reduction): 1-2ms (memory allocation) 1-2ms (memory discard) Pure memory operation![IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: Prompt: Performance cost breakdown comparison chart. Left bar showing truncation costs: "TRUNCATE ops (20-30ms)" in red, "Sequence resets (10-15ms)" in orange, "Connection overhead (5-10ms)" in yellow, totaling 40-60ms per test.

Include annotations: "50-75% reduction" and "Pure memory operation" for rollback. Style: modern bar chart with gradient colors, clear cost labels, benchmark comparison.]Override 's  method to wrap test execution in database transactions:Setup OUTSIDE transaction - Database schema and reference data loads once per test suite - Each test runs atomically and always rolls back - Clear caches (, converted models, email collectors, )Why Override  Instead of Using Standard Hooks?The core issue is how 's  works: uses  to execute code inside a transaction blockIt sets thread-local variables to track the active transaction connectionIndividual database operations check these thread variables to reuse the transaction connectionThis pattern requires wrapping the  from the outsideStandard  lifecycle hooks have a fatal limitation, as there is no  or wrapper mechanism.By overriding , we control the  of operations and can properly use :1. Setup (OUTSIDE transaction)     ← Reference data persists
2. Begin transaction with yield
3. Test code (INSIDE transaction)  ← Thread variables track connection
4. Rollback transaction
5. Teardown (OUTSIDE transaction)  ← Clear caches, email collectors

Solution: use  for tests instead.
  
  
  Story: The Optimization and Discovery
When setting up a  application to work with , I moved all initialization instructions to  hooks:After tests were working reliably, I optimized: why run this repetitive setup for every test? If I moved it to module-level initialization, it would run once when test file loads:Tests passed initially. But when I ran with  to enable verbose output, something broke:1 crystal run /users_test.cr
Channel::ClosedError: Channel is closed
    /usr/share/crystal/src/channel.cr:142:8 in 'send'
    /usr/share/crystal/src/log/dispatch.cr:55:7 in 'dispatch'
The logging channel was closed. I reverted to  as a workaround, but I needed to understand: Why does  setup runs matter more than  it runs?
  
  
  Investigation: The Key Discovery

  
  
  Why Minitest Is Different
 doesn't run tests during normal program execution. Instead:This creates a timing problem. With module-level setup: initialize a Log instance with  on booting spawns a background fiber with a channelMain program completes →  runtime cleanup beginsChannel may be closed by garbage collection (this is where my assumption lies) fires →  runs testsTests call  → channel already closed → With , setup happens inside , so the  instance is created during shutdown, not during normal execution.
  
  
  How  Works
During shutdown, garbage collection calls , which closes the channel. But  hooks run  some cleanup, creating the race condition.The issue isn't optimization itself—it's that  isn't suitable for code that runs before . The solution is to use a dispatcher without background resources for tests:For tests with module-level init,  is ideal.The optimization itself was sound—module-level initialization  faster. The issue was incompatibility with  in a shutdown context.More broadly, any code that relies on objects with finalize methods could be affected by garbage collection events and  timing—background resources created during normal execution may be cleaned up before tests run.The fix is simple (one configuration change) but reveals a broader principle:Test infrastructure must account for shutdown order and resource cleanup timing, regardless of framework. Some libraries use  handlers for cleanup in multi-threaded applications, and when tests run after these handlers, any finalized objects (channels, connections, files, caches) become inaccessible.]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
