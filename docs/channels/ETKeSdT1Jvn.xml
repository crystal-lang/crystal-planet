It’s time for Day 2 Ops in the world of AI.

Building enterprise-ready AI poses challenges around data security,scalability, and integration, especially in compliance-regulated industries. Firms are increasing efforts to mitigate risks associated with LLMs regarding sensitive data exfiltration of personally identifiable information and sensitive company data. The primary mitigation strategy is to build guardrails around Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to safeguard data while also optimizing query response quality and efficiency. 

To enable precise guardrails, one must implement permissions systems with advanced fine grained authorization capabilities such as returning lists of authorized subjects and accessible resources. Such systems ensure that LLMs can access only authorized data while preventing exfiltration of sensitive information, making RAGs more efficient and improving performance at scale. 

This session will cover how modern permissions systems can safeguard sensitive data in RAG pipelines. We'll start with why Authorization is critical for RAG pipelines to protect sensitive data from potential vulnerabilities and also the various techniques for permissions-aware data retrieval. The talk will also include a practical demo implementing fine-grained authorization for RAG using Pinecone, Langchain, OpenAI, and SpiceDB - an Open Source authorization database.

So, you’ve got a new colleague: an AI agent. It doesn’t need coffee breaks, doesn’t complain about on-call schedules, and (so it claims) can debug faster than you. Sounds perfect, right? Well, until it starts spamming Slack at 3 AM or, worse, decides it has production access opinions.

In this session, we’ll dive into the chaotic, glorious reality of managing AI agents as part of your SRE team. We’ll tackle the tough questions: How do you assign permissions to something that thinks it’s always right? How do you monitor and log what your robot coworker is doing (and why it thought deleting all your service accounts was a good idea)? And most importantly, how do you keep it from going rogue and bringing down prod on a Friday night?

With a mix of traditional SRE practices and new strategies tailored for AI agents, we’ll explore how to establish trust, maintain control, and avoid turning your AI into an unmanageable production liability. By the end of this talk, you’ll have the tools to SRE your AI colleague—because we all know it’s not a real teammate until it’s on-call with you.

The current process of identifying the root cause of a package build failure in Copr or Koji is time-consuming and requires considerable expertise. Log Detective proposes an automated log analysis system to help diagnose such failures and assist maintainers.

Log Detective uses Template Mining and Large Language Models to process your log files. It’s very simple to use, just go to https://logdetective.com/explain, paste a link to your log file, wait one minute and the service will explain that log to you.

Existing models like granite, llama, or mistral can give good feedback on your logs, but they don't understand our specific ecosystem. We are collecting log annotations to train our own models under the CDLA-Permissive-2.0 license. Our aim is to create a service that provides near-perfect explanations and solutions, as if an experienced maintainer was guiding you.

In this talk, we’ll give you an overview of Log Detective, explain the technical decisions and finish with a demo. You shouldn’t miss this talk if you are building software as your job.

Our team maintains a large-scale codebase for detecting and predicting issues in clusters, with hundreds of validation rules contributed and regularly updated by SRE engineers. A key challenge is identifying false positives and predicting which validations are most likely to require fixes.

In this research, we analyze validation rules as repeated code patterns, creating a unique dataset for machine learning. We compute numerical descriptors—such as code length, complexity, entropy, and time since introduction—across different Git branches and compare them with historical bug fixes. Preliminary results indicate strong correlations between these factors and validation reliability.

In this talk, we will present our findings using classical machine learning models and benchmark them against modern large language models (LLMs). We will discuss the effectiveness of both approaches, and the potential impact on automated validation quality improvement.

The Linux kernel RTNL mutex is the big lock protecting all of the internal kernel data structures related to networking. While there is work underway in the upstream community to reduce its scope, today this mutex is a major source of scalability problems in the kernel networking subsystem. It mostly affects control path operations (such as bringing network interfaces up and down), but unless care is taken to avoid it, RTNL lock issues can also spill over into the data path, causing intermittent stalls in networking applications that can be
hard to debug.

In this talk I will dive into techniques for debugging applications stalls caused by contention on the RTNL lock, using an example application that is derived from a real-world case. We will look at kernel tracing tools that can be used to identify and debug such issues, and talk about ways to mitigate them in the application. I will also briefly outline the upstream efforts to reduce the scope of the RTNL in the kernel, and how this will affect systems going forward.

These new algorithms include new primitives like Key Encryption Mechanisms (KEMS) that can be built from either Key Exchange Algorithms (KEX) or Key Encryption Algorithms (KEA). Signatures now include primitives that require the signature before the hash verification starts. This talk walks through these new ideas, now PKCS #11 handles them and how they new algorithms actually work.

Keylime is a TPM-based remote attestation framework that originally relied on a pull model, where the verifier initiated attestation requests to monitored systems. However, this approach posed challenges for edge and IoT environments, where devices often operate with constrained resources and behind firewalls.

In this talk, we’ll dive into the transition from a pull-based model to a push-based (agent-driven) attestation model, where the agent on the monitored system actively pushes integrity measurements to the verifier. We’ll explore the architectural changes, the technical challenges we tackled, and how this shift makes remote attestation more practical for edge, cloud, and IoT deployments.

Additionally, we’ll highlight how this work was made possible through open-source collaboration, showcasing not only the technical advancements in Keylime but also the power of open-source development in solving real-world security challenges.

This presentation explores a novel approach to passwordless authentication in Gnome, leveraging the power of [SSSD](https://sssd.io/) and a newly developed extension to the Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) conversation. We introduce a JSON-based messaging system that significantly enriches the communication between PAM modules and client applications, enabling sophisticated authentication flows. This enhanced communication facilitates contextual information sharing, adaptive authentication, and seamless multi-factor authentication, all within the familiar GNOME desktop environment.
The talk delves into the technical details of this JSON-based interface between SSSD and [GDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Display_Manager), providing insights into its [design](https://github.com/SSSD/sssd.io/pull/79) and implementation. Furthermore, a simple PAM rust application will be presented as a practical example, serving as a reference for developers seeking to integrate this protocol into their own PAM applications. This opens up a wide range of possibilities for enhanced authentication flows, including:

* **Contextual information**: sharing user-specific data or authentication challenges.
* **Adaptive authentication**: dynamically adjusting authentication steps.
* **Multi-Factor authentication**: orchestrating complex authentication sequences.

The presentation will conclude with live demonstrations showcasing the capabilities of this extended PAM conversation and its potential for innovation in authentication systems.
We will also share the current development status and preliminary GUI designs, subject to ongoing development progress.

Large Language Models (LLM) require preprocessing vast amounts of data, a process that can span days due to its complexity and scale, often involving PetaBytes of data. This talk demonstrates how Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP) simplify LLM data processing with flexibility, repeatability, and scalability. These pipelines are being used daily at IBM Research to build indemnified LLMs tailored for enterprise applications.
Different data preparation toolkits are built on Kubernetes, Rust, Slurm, or Spark. How would you choose one for your own LLM experiments or enterprise use cases and why should you consider Kubernetes and KFP?
This talk describes how open source Data Prep Toolkit leverages KFP and KubeRay for scalable pipeline orchestration, e.g. deduplication, content classification, and tokenization.
We share challenges, lessons, and insights from our experience with KFP, highlighting its applicability for diverse LLM tasks, such as data preprocessing, RAG retrieval, and model fine-tuning.

Vulnerability discovery is one of the crucial aspects of software supply chain security. We want to know which of the components in our software projects are affected by certain vulnerabilities, are they exploitable and how severe exploits are.

Organizations take different approaches to this topic, from using commercial software scanners to embedding SSCS practices early in their development process and preventing the usage and release of vulnerable projects.

In this session we will look behind the scene of software vulnerability management. Where is all the data coming from? What are the formats in which data is exchanged? We will dig into the world of CVEs and VEXs (Vulnerability exchange) and show how efforts like the OSV (Open Source Vulnerability) database help us keep safe. We discuss some of the challenges of living in this multi-truth world.

In the end we will demo how project Trustify (https://github.com/trustification/trustify/) collects and analyses all this data, in order to provide up to date vulnerability information for your SBOMs.

What’s the process? What’s the way of thinking? What are issues, problems, questions about God and God’s existence? Can conventional wisdom be avoided? Can progress be made?

It was a triumphant showcase of the most extraordinary achievements of the Victorian age from industry, culture and engineering - gathered from all four corners of the globe. As visitors walked the 8 miles of exhibitions, they would have seen everything from the sublime to the absurd: the world’s largest diamond, a contraption to predict the weather using leeches, the world's first public flushing toilets and a two-person piano.The enormous glass and iron building that housed the exhibition was big enough to house four St Pauls Cathedrals and its construction involved some of the most famous engineers of the Victorian age - Brunel, Faraday, Stephenson and Paxton.To tell Dan the story of the Crystal Palace is historian and conservationist Steven Brindle.Produced by Mariana Des Forges and edited by Tim Arstall.You can now find Dan Snow's History Hit on YouTube!

God and time are two huge mysteries. Relating them probes the nature of God, and perhaps even the existence of God. God, in order to be Creator, must create everything other than God’s own self, which includes time. But if God is in time and experiences its passage, then how could God have created time? Also Leibniz’s question: “Why didn’t God create the world sooner?”

What remarkable discoveries are being made in cosmology! Cosmologists now develop credible theories about the beginning and end of our universe and theory-based speculations about vast numbers of multiple universes. But does the cosmos have a reason? Could revolutionary ideas support some kind of ‘universal reason’? The bar is set high, and it is OK to say no.

But one of the biggest challenges facing businesses today, that I particularly care about, is how to unlock the true potential of AI by leveraging a company’s operational business data. At Snow Leopard, we aim to bridge the gap between AI systems and critical business data that is locked away in databases, data warehouses, and other API-based systems, so enterprises can use live business data from any data source – whether it's database, warehouse, or APIs – in real time and on demand, natively. In this interview, I'd like to cover Snow Leopard’s intelligent data retrieval approach that can leverage business data directly and on-demand to make AI work.Deepti is the founder and CEO of Snow Leopard AI, a platform that helps teams build AI apps using their live business data, on-demand. She has nearly 2 decades of experience in data platforms and infrastructure.As Head of Product at Observable, Deepti led the 0→1 product and GTM strategy in the crowded data analytics market. Before that, Deepti was the founding PM for Google Spanner, growing it to thousands of internal customers (Ads, PlayStore, Gmail, etc.), before launching it externally as a seminal cloud database service. Deepti started her career as a distributed systems engineer in the RAC database kernel at Oracle.Website: https://www.snowleopard.ai/AI SQL Data Analyst // Donné Stevenson - https://youtu.be/hwgoNmyCGhQ~~~~~~~~ ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ ~~~~~~~Catch all episodes, blogs, newsletters, and more: https://go.mlops.community/TYExploreJoin our Slack community [https://go.mlops.community/slack]Follow us on X/Twitter [@mlopscommunity](https://x.com/mlopscommunity) or [LinkedIn](https://go.mlops.community/linkedin)] Sign up for the next meetup: [https://go.mlops.community/register]MLOps Swag/Merch: [https://shop.mlops.community/]Connect with Demetrios on LinkedIn: /dpbrinkmConnect with Deepti on LinkedIn: /thedeepti/[00:00] Deepti's preferred coffee[00:49] MLflow vs Kubeflow Debate[04:58] GenAI Data Integration Challenges[09:02] GenAI Sidecar Spicy Takes[14:07] Troubleshooting LLM Hallucinations[19:03] AI Overengineering and Hype[25:06] Self-Serve Analytics Governance[33:29] Dashboards vs Data Quality[37:06] Agent Database Context Control[43:00] LLM as Orchestrator[47:34] Tool Call Ownership Clarification[51:45] MCP Server Challenges]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Mysteries of Easter Island</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/the-mysteries-of-easter-island</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/68528d70259ce49e3e5b26ef/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=Bzgx63z2s3e3Fdm9aMnkEBavEUONpdLV2t2CyF4STi4" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 23:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In the heart of the Pacific Ocean, over 2,000 miles from the nearest continent, lies one of the world’s most iconic archaeological treasure troves - Rapa Nui, known to the outside world as Easter Island.

The more we want God to exist, the more we must question so-called ‘proofs’ of God’s existence. God likely appreciates skeptics, those who genuinely seek and genuinely doubt. Skeptics provide real service: they help clear up or clean out poor arguments for God. Is it possible all the ‘God arguments’ are bad?
