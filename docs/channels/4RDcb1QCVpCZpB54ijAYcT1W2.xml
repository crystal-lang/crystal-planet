Details are in this issue. I originally kept it on RESP2 because, at the time, nothing was using RESP3. Even the modules owned by Redis Labs (now just called Redis, Inc) were still outputting RESP2 data types.The downside is that it’s a pretty breaking change, which is difficult for something like Redis where most applications aren’t using it directly and are instead using it through shards like  and . Both of those shards do dependency management well and would avoid this breaking change until they were ready to upgrade, but others might not.Anyway, if anyone’s willing to take a look and offer feedback, that would be helpful.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>fast-http-server: Super fast, zero configuration command line HTTP Server</title><link>https://old.reddit.com/r/crystal_programming/comments/1rhrcu3/fasthttpserver_super_fast_zero_configuration/</link><author>/u/sdogruyol</author><category>community</category><pubDate>Sun, 1 Mar 2026 07:46:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://old.reddit.com/r/crystal_programming/">r/crystal_programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Projects that shouldn&apos;t work: doomcr</title><link>https://forum.crystal-lang.org/t/projects-that-shouldnt-work-doomcr/8740</link><author>omarluq</author><category>community</category><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 03:32:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://forum.crystal-lang.org/latest">Forum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I did a fun and useless thing: put Doom in the terminal with Crystal.

There was a problem expanding macro 'macro_140407006690976'

Which expanded to:

         ^
Error: can't find file 'sanitize'

If you're trying to require a shard:
- Did you remember to run `shards install`?
- Did you make sure you're running the compiler in the same directory as your shard.yml?
I notice sanitize is a shards  in the crystal source code, but after I installed my self-compiled crystal compiler.not install(copy) following folder into dest install folder

Individual specs run fine when executed separately.This issue consistently happens on macOS / Apple Silicon.Clearing the cache () does not fix the issue; it still hangs right after the Codegen/linking stage.CPU Usage: While hanging, both the  process and the compiled  binary sit at 0.0% CPU (State ). I think.. this indicates a deadlock or a blocking wait rather than an infinite loop.You can reproduce this by cloning the OWASP Noir repository and running .Architecture: Apple Silicon (ARM64)I suspect this might be a macOS-specific LLVM or spec runner issue, possibly a deadlock when the runner tries to execute the compiled spec binary. Has anyone seen this behavior before, or have any pointers on how to debug this further?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Retriggering a shards postinstall?</title><link>https://forum.crystal-lang.org/t/retriggering-a-shards-postinstall/8737</link><author>Fijxu</author><category>community</category><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 05:20:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://forum.crystal-lang.org/latest">Forum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Some tools that I use like Ameba and cr-source-typer execute a postinstall (example: cr-source-typer/shard.yml at master · Vici37/cr-source-typer · GitHub ) and will place it’s executable in the  directory of the current project, but when the system is updated, shared libraries change and then the shard binary has to be rebuilt, but shards does not seem to have an easy way to re trigger the postinstall without removing the dependency from the  file and running shards install <dependency>.There is any other way to do it? Would be great is shards could keep track of the installed binaries from dependencies and check if their linked libraries are still valid or something like that.]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
