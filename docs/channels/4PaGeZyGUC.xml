[This documentary was originally released in 2020]

Since the Islamic Republic of Iran was founded in 1979, there has been a war between Iran, Israel and the US. The war has never been officially declared, and there has been no real reconciliation.

Part One of this two-part documentary focuses on the origins of the conflict between Iran and Israel. It began when the Israelis invaded Lebanon to confront a new Lebanese Shiite force backed by Iran: Hezbollah.

Throughout the Middle East, targeted assassinations, bombings, and non-military attacks with no clear attribution are on the rise. Could the "secret war" between Iran and Israel escalate into a major regional or even global confrontation? The two countries are dominant powers in today’s Middle East. Yet Iran and Israel have failed to resolve their historical disputes, and there has never been significant dialogue between them. And what role does the United States play in the conflict? 

Based on painstaking archival research and featuring high-profile players in Israel, Iran, Lebanon and the US, the film looks back on the more than forty years since Iran’s Islamic Revolution. It explores key moments and provides ways of understanding the new Middle East.

In this video we're following NASA's Lucy spacecraft on its journey to Jupiter's mysterious Trojan asteroids. Lucy has already stunned scientists by visiting the tiniest main-belt asteroid and discovering its oddly-shaped moon - the first contact-binary satellite ever found! Lucy will reach the Trojan swarm in 2027, hoping these ancient time capsules can shed light on our solar system's formation: What are these ancient rocks made of? Where did they come from? And can they unlock the keys to understanding our own cosmic origins?

--

In 2021, the Parker Solar Probe achieved its mission to touch the Sun, skimming through its outermost atmosphere. Since then, it’s carved closer and closer paths, but probing deeper into the corona— without melting, exploding, or falling into the Sun— is a monumental engineering challenge. Is it possible? Explore the obstacles of the mission and how it could unlock the mysteries of our star.

Thanks to our sponsor, T-Mobile: http://t-mobile.com/FirstResponders

In US small towns, emergency fire and ambulance first responder agencies are still mostly staffed by volunteers – a practice put in place in the 1970s and 1980s. But these volunteers are increasingly older, with fewer young people signing up than previous decades. Higher cost of living and a diminishing rural population has made volunteering less appealing than it used to be. We interviewed experts in the field of emergency response to figure out how to get those volunteers back, and the answer may be a simple one: pay them for their time.

Against her husband's wishes, she trains to become a solar technician. In doing so, she initiates a shift in patriarchal traditions.

In the former Fulbe kingdom of "Fouta Toro” on the border between Senegal and Mauritania, there are villages so remote that the nearest town is several hours away by car. There is no connection to the electricity grid here. Néné lives in one of these villages. At the market, she heard about an NGO that gives women the opportunity to learn about solar energy. Néné decides to visit the NGO: Her village needs electricity.

Before Néné, no woman had ever left her village, attended school or learned anything other than how to feed animals, cultivate fields, look after children and prepare food. Néné's husband doesn't want to let her go, but she resists his wishes. She decides to train as a solar technician.

Néné is not alone - other women will be taking part in the training alongside her. As they board the minibus bound for the city, their first step into a new life begins. At the training center, they experience running water and electricity for the first time. The sea and the hustle and bustle of the big city are also new to them.

Four months later, the women return to the village, bringing with them much-desired know-how. They explain how the houses can be supplied with solar energy. Little by little, solar power is finding its way into people's everyday lives. Through their actions and their training, the women subtly raise questions about the meaning of modernity -- and the position of women in society.

From the filmmakers of "The Gene" and "Cancer: The Emperor of All Maladies," and Executive Produced by Bradley Cooper, "Caregiving" is a groundbreaking new documentary from Well Beings that personalizes America’s caregiving crisis. Featuring intimate stories and expert voices, the film highlights the struggles and triumphs of caregivers nationwide. 

The two-hour documentary is centered on the personal experiences of caregivers providing for loved ones, and the challenges and triumph they face each day. As the number of caregivers declines, and the number of individuals requiring care in our country increases, the challenges grow. Caregivers require differing types and levels of support. At times, the burdens of caregiving can seem unbearable, regardless of resources. The “needs gap” for information may be greater for caregivers than it is for care recipients. The film will explore these issues and shine a light on innovation for 21st century caregiving. Narrated by Award-winning actress Uzo Aduba.

And yet despite the differences in size, population and resources – the tiny nation of Iceland won every time. In this video we'll examine why.

ABSTRACT
One of the most contentious words in technology culture today is “Architect.” I experience an endless stream of divisive, confusing opinions about what "architecture" means. At a conference, an attendee noticed that my badge said "architect" and told me "I want to be an architect too, but I don't know enough about Kubernetes yet".

Architecture, in the systems age, is not (just) Kubernetes. It's not the implementation of any particular toolset. Architecture is designing relationships between parts and adapting those relationship patterns as circumstances change. This requires engaging our mental models and working together to transform them.

The architecture skillset is socio-technical -- a blend of social and technology skills. It is a way of thinking and communicating. In the modern age, there is no division between the way we think together and the code running in production. Our thinking designs our architecture.

Architecture is structuring good systems thinking.

In this talk, I will admit that sometimes architecture is Kubernetes. And share five essential qualities that make a good architect a great architect, regardless of the toolset they employ. [...]

With Lara Anderson</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fplTT3IrxDw</link><author>StarTalk</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/fplTT3IrxDw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 18:20:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoAEDirJPjEUFcF2FklnBA">StarTalk</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[What is string theory, really? Why does it need extra dimensions? Neil deGrasse Tyson and comedian Chuck Nice welcome theoretical physicist and mathematician Lara Anderson to guide us through string theory, higher dimensions, and finding a unifying theory of everything.

Could it be the long-sought bridge between quantum mechanics and Einstein’s theory of gravity? We explore the problem between relativity and quantum physics, and why things break down when combined. Could strings be the key to unifying these two frameworks? How do strings explain particles? And if they’re so small we can’t detect them, how can we confirm the theory?

Have we reached a fundamental particle yet? Lara walks us through the geometry of hidden additional dimensions and how to get around untestable theories. Learn about the math behind string theory and the vision Chuck had about the dimensionality of the universe. Can you have two time dimensions? Or a compactified time dimension? Discover how there are an infinite number of quantum theories for not our universe and what it means to consider a spherical cow. Can string theory produce the particle physics we see? 

We tackle string theory skepticism, the “string landscape,” and the unexpected discoveries made along the way, like the holographic principle to dualities that link seemingly unrelated theories. What does it mean when two different geometries produce the same physics? And is string theory actually connected to the physics we observe? Can AI help us navigate the math? Plus, we discuss the topology of knots and why you can tie a knot in four dimensions. Could string theory be the gateway to new physics?

The conflict in Ukraine has shown that warfare is changing. Can the German armed forces keep up?

New weaponry is being developed: from drones to artificial intelligence and automatic missile defense systems. Germany’s military, the Bundeswehr, is rearming on a large scale while assessing its future priorities. For example, are expensive tanks still suitable for battle when they can be destroyed by cheap drones? And what future role will multi-million-euro fighter planes play?
Analysts say that Russia will be in a position to attack NATO territory in five to eight years' time. That’s led high-ranking German military officials to call for the country to be sufficiently armed by 2029. But how realistic is that goal?

Another concern is the risk of collateral damage caused by the misjudgments of artificial intelligence. Previously, it was hoped that modern weapons like drones would require fewer soldiers on the frontlines. But experts now believe these more complicated weapons will require more maintenance and therefore more personnel. According to military experts, modern warfare will ironically demand more soldiers than before.

How are Germany, NATO and Russia positioned militarily? Who is spending vast sums on which technologies? And just how much weaponry is actually sensible or justifiable?

Ever since Einstein published his Special Theory of Relativity, one equation has been the bane of humans hoping to explore the stars: E=mc². In addition to informing our understanding of gravity, space, and time, this formula implies that traveling at or beyond light speed is impossible. Why is that? Lindsay DeMarchi and Fabio Pacucci explain the physics behind this unbreakable speed limit.

In this video, we break down what probiotics actually are, whether they do what they claim, and how yogurt fits into the picture. Are all yogurts probiotic? Are probiotics even worth it? Or is it all just a marketing scam?

I'm Thomas and I do videos and reviews on mechanical keyboards ranging from the most sickening modern RGB gaming keyboards to vintage hardware relics, or sometimes keycaps or keyswitches ranging from Cherry MX to Alps SKCM to IBM buckling springs and anything in between.

The practice sentence was: "Hello my name is Thomas and I'm typing on an Epomaker Cypher 96 right now. A pretty useful, if fairly ugly, piece of kit. I still hope 8bitdo bring one out someday!"]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Furious man says republicans aren’t American</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/01DDzsFEC5k</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/01DDzsFEC5k?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 22:09:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The consequences of US’s attack on Iran’s nuclear sites #shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/oxDJqUHikr0</link><author>Vox</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/oxDJqUHikr0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 22:03:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA">Vox</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Things that could make Trump’s attack on Iran spiral out of control

Some celebrate nationalist Karol Nawrocki; others fear setbacks on LGBTQ rights and abortion.

Last autumn, euphoria swept through Poland: Donald Tusk had won the parliamentary election, unseating the right-wing populist government after eight years. Poland showed what was possible - a shift away from nationalism to a more progressive society. But now, populist candidate Karol Nawrocki is changing that. After a surprise win in the presidential election, Nawrocki vowed to make life difficult for the liberal government.
