It's now simple called \"Edit.\" Ars Technica reports: \nAside from ease of use, Microsoft's main reason for creating the new version of Edit stems from a peculiar gap in modern Windows. \"What motivated us to build Edit was the need for a default CLI text editor in 64-bit versions of Windows,\" writes [Christopher Nguyen, a product manager on Microsoft's Windows Terminal team] while referring to the command-line interface, or CLI. \"32-bit versions of Windows ship with the MS-DOS editor, but 64-bit versions do not have a CLI editor installed inbox.\" [...]\n \nLinux users can download Edit from the project's GitHub releases page or install it through an unofficial snap package. Oh, and if you're a fan of the vintage editor and crave a 16-bit text-mode for your retro machine that actually runs MS-DOS, you can download a copy on the Internet Archive. [...]\n \nAt 250KB, the new Edit maintains the lightweight philosophy of its predecessor while adding features the original couldn't dream of: Unicode support, regular expressions, and the ability to handle gigabyte-sized files. The original editor was limited to files smaller than 300KB depending on available conventional memory -- a constraint that seems quaint in an era of terabyte storage. But the web publication OMG! Ubuntu found that the modern Edit not only \"works great on Ubuntu\" but noted its speed when handling gigabyte-sized documents.","contentLength":1551,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Linus Torvalds Photographed with Bill Gates - for the First Time Ever","url":"https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/06/22/2131259/linus-torvalds-photographed-with-bill-gates---for-the-first-time-ever?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1750628040,"author":"EditorDavid","guid":294,"unread":true,"content":"\"The worlds of Linux and Windows finally came together in real life...\" writes The Verge:\n\n\nMicrosoft co-founder Bill Gates and Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux kernel, have surprisingly never met before.

That made sense, because people kept somehow turning it entirely off and now it's required by Steam. Currently, there's still an option in the stable Steam Client that you need to manually check to enable Steam Play (Proton) for \"all other titles\". This is something of a leftover from when Proton was initially revealed, and only worked for a specific set of games on Valve's whitelist. It now covers what Valve set by default for Steam Deck and SteamOS verification.\n \nWhat's changed is that at some point in the recent Steam Beta releases, is that \"for all other titles\" option is gone. I've scrolled back through changelogs and not seen it mentioned. So now, Proton is just enabled properly in full by default in the Steam Beta like shown in the [image here]. This is a good (and needed) change that I'm happy to see. There's often confusion when people try to run Windows games on Linux and end up with no install button because Proton isn't turned on for all titles. [This] will soon be a thing of the past.

Balancing that, this version only supports the Raspberry Pi 4 and 5 series; it drops Rocky 9.x's support for the older Pi 3 and Pi Zero models... \n\nRHEL 10 itself, and Rocky with it, now require x86-64-v3, meaning Intel \"Haswell\" generation kit from about 2013 onward. Uniquely among the RHELatives, AlmaLinux offers a separate build of version 10 for x86-64-v2 as well, meaning Intel \"Nehalem\" and later — chips from roughly 2008 onward. AlmaLinux has a history of still supporting hardware that's been dropped from RHEL and Rocky, which it's been doing since AlmaLinux 9.4. Now that includes CPUs. In comparison, the system requirements for Rocky Linux 10 are the same as for RHEL 10. The release notes say.... \"The most significant change in Rocky Linux 10 is the removal of support for x86-64-v2 architectures. AMD and Intel 64-bit architectures for x86-64-v3 are now required.\" \n\nA significant element of the advertising around RHEL 10 involves how it has an AI assistant.

It's much easier than searching man pages, especially if you don't know what to look for... [N]either AlmaLinux 10 nor Rocky Linux 10 includes the option of a helper bot. No big surprise there...\n[Rocky Linux] is sticking closest to upstream, thanks to a clever loophole to obtain source RPMs. Its hardware requirements also closely parallel RHEL 10, and CIQ is working on certifications, compliance, and special editions. Meanwhile, AlmaLinux is maintaining support for older hardware and CPUs, which will widen its appeal, and working with partners to ensure reboot-free updates and patching, rather than CIQ's keep-it-in-house approach. All are valid, and all three still look and work almost identically... except for the LLM bot assistant.","contentLength":2148,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Denmark Is Dumping Microsoft Office and Windows For LibreOffice and Linux","url":"https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/06/12/0335229/denmark-is-dumping-microsoft-office-and-windows-for-libreoffice-and-linux?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1749727800,"author":"BeauHD","guid":291,"unread":true,"content":"An anonymous reader quotes a report from ZDNet: Denmark's Minister of Digitalization, Caroline Stage, has announced that the Danish government will start moving away from Microsoft Office to LibreOffice.

EU leaders are seeking to reduce Europe's dependence on foreign technology providers, primarily those from the United States, and to assert greater control over its digital infrastructure, data, and technological future. Why? Because they're concerned about who controls European data, who sets the rules, and who can potentially cut off access to essential services in times of geopolitical tension. \"Money issues have also played a decisive role,\" writes ZDNet's Steven Vaughan-Nichols. \"Copenhagen's Microsoft software bill has soared from 313 million kroner in 2018 to 538 million kroner -- about $53 million in 2023, a 72% increase in just five years.\n \nDavid Heinemeier Hansson (DHH), a Dane, inventor of Ruby on Rails, and co-owner of the software developer company 37Signals, has said: \"Denmark is one of the most highly digitalized countries in the world.

Container runs standard OCI images, but it doesn't use a single shared Linux VM. Instead, it creates a small Linux virtual machine for every container you spin up.

The software \"is a decentralized alternative to the central WordPress.org plugin and theme ecosystem, designed to return control to WordPress hosts and developers. It operates as a drop-in WordPress plugin, seamlessly replacing existing centralized services with a federated, open-source infrastructure.\" In addition to providing some measure of stability, the Linux Foundation sees the FAIR Package Manager as advancing WordPress' alignment with Europe's General Data Protection Regulation by reducing automatic browser data transmission and telemetry sent to commercial entities, while also supporting modern security practices and strengthening the open source software supply chain.","contentLength":2142,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Linux User Share Hits a Multi-Year High On Steam For May 2025","url":"https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/06/02/2124213/linux-user-share-hits-a-multi-year-high-on-steam-for-may-2025?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1748901600,"author":"BeauHD","guid":288,"unread":true,"content":"Linux user share on Steam rose to 2.69% in May 2025 -- the highest level recorded since at least 2018.

Tools like Apport and systemd-coredump are designed to handle crash reporting and core dumps in Linux systems. \"These race conditions allow a local attacker to exploit a SUID program and gain read access to the resulting core dump,\" Saeed Abbasi, manager of product at Qualys TRU, said... \nRed Hat said CVE-2025-4598 has been rated Moderate in severity owing to the high complexity in pulling an exploit for the vulnerability, noting that the attacker has to first win the race condition and be in possession of an unprivileged local account... Qualys has also developed proof-of-concept code for both vulnerabilities, demonstrating how a local attacker can exploit the coredump of a crashed unix_chkpwd process, which is used to verify the validity of a user's password, to obtain password hashes from the /etc/shadow file. \nAdvisories were also issued by Gentoo, Amazon Linux, and Debian, the article points out.
