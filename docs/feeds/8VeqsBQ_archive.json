Crystal frameworks dominate speed</strong></p><p>The main speed-competitor in Crystal-land is Raze framework (which has been retired).

However, that's too many results for my taste 😊 i.e. things like \"h2o.cr\" on the list are too purpose-specific for me or anything I would do in a normal course of things, developing an enterprise or user-facing web application.</p><p>I'm currently considering a Full-Stack Framework for a small web-based enterprise-type project and deciding between Phoenix, Lucky &amp; Rails.

GUI programming, in general, depends heavily on opaque, platform-specific APIs, which don’t always play nicely with open-source development.</p><p>Then I got curious about <a href=\"https://tauri.app/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tauri</a> and <a href=\"https://www.electronjs.org\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Electron</a> — the now-famous WebView-based app frameworks.</p><p>Personally, I can barely read JavaScript, so I had no real interest in those at first, but their popularity made me curious.</p><p>And as I mentioned earlier, web app development in the Crystal ecosystem is quite active.</p><p>So I decided to give it a try.</p><p>I learned that “WebView” isn’t a single library — each OS (Windows, Linux, macOS) provides its own.</p><p>Projects like <a href=\"https://github.com/webview/webview\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">webview/webview</a> and Tauri’s <a href=\"https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wry</a> act as unifying layers over these platform-specific APIs.</p><p>Tauri itself uses WebView under the hood while also providing a framework to handle security and integration with Rust backends.</p><p>Maybe it’s possible to use TypeScript and other frontend tools with Crystal too, but personally, I prefer the more old-fashioned approach — something like <a href=\"https://github.com/kemalcr/kemal\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kemal</a> + <a href=\"https://crystal-lang.org/api/ECR.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ECR</a>, the “classic amateur” way.</p><p>When I actually started building an app with Crystal + WebView, I discovered a few things.</p><p>First, you need to pay attention to event loops and thread management.</p><p>The WebView itself runs in a separate process, and at the same time you need to run a Kemal server.</p><p>That means you often have to make it multithreaded and carefully manage your execution contexts or Fibers — otherwise, things simply won’t run correctly.</p><p>Then there’s the build, linking, and packaging pain.</p><p>I sent <a href=\"https://github.com/naqvis/webview/pulls?q=+author%3Akojix2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a few pull requests</a> to the Crystal WebView project, which helped a bit, but building on MinGW is still rough.</p><p>MSVC technically works, but it’s just too tedious to deal with, so I decided to stay away from it.</p><p>Bundling shared libraries is also tricky.</p><p>I’d prefer to lean toward static linking whenever possible, but depending on licensing and security update concerns, it’s sometimes better to link against system or bundled shared libraries.</p><p>I discovered tools like <a href=\"https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fpm</a>, which are really useful, but in the end, I still end up asking AI to help me write custom GitHub Actions YAML and shell scripts.</p><p>And then, once you finally have a working binary, Windows or macOS antivirus software will happily flag it as suspicious.</p><p>Maybe for people doing this professionally, all this doesn’t sound like a big deal, but as someone doing it for fun, it’s a lot of work.\nEven so, after all the pain, I’ve started to feel like — maybe, just maybe — this setup is actually pretty cool.</p><p>This post was translated from the original Japanese version using ChatGPT.<p>\nYou can read the original post </p><a href=\"https://qiita.com/kojix2/items/e9bb62e9ff9f966b36a4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a> [JA]</p>","contentLength":3784,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How a quartz crystal works in a microcontroller?","url":"https://dev.to/carolineee/how-a-quartz-crystal-works-in-a-microcontroller-4lhf","date":1760434663,"author":"Hedy","guid":81,"unread":true,"content":"<p>This is a fundamental concept in <a href=\"https://www.ampheo.com/c/microcontrollers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">microcontroller</a> systems. Let's break down how a quartz <a href=\"https://www.onzuu.com/category/crystals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">crystal</a> works in a microcontroller, from the basic physics to the practical circuit.</p><p><strong>The Core Concept: The Piezoelectric Effect</strong>\nAt the heart of a quartz crystal is a physical phenomenon called the Piezoelectric Effect.</p><ul><li>Mechanical → Electrical: When you apply a physical stress (squeeze or bend) to a quartz crystal, it generates a small electrical voltage across its surfaces.</li><li>Electrical → Mechanical: Conversely, when you apply an electrical voltage to a quartz crystal, it physically deforms (vibrates) slightly.</li></ul><p>This two-way street is the magic key.</p><p><strong>How It Creates a Clock Signal: Resonance</strong></p><ol><li><p>Natural Frequency: Every piece of quartz crystal has a natural resonant frequency—a specific frequency at which it \"likes\" to vibrate most efficiently. This frequency is determined primarily by its physical size, shape, and how it's cut. A thinner, smaller crystal vibrates at a higher frequency. This is why crystals for common microcontrollers (like 16 MHz, 20 MHz) are small, while crystals for real-time clocks (32.768 kHz) are larger and often cylindrical.</p></li><li><p>The <a href=\"https://www.onzuu.com/category/oscillators\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Oscillator</a> Circuit: Inside the microcontroller, there is a specialized circuit called a Crystal Oscillator (often denoted as OSC1 and OSC2 pins). This circuit is designed to:</p></li></ol><ul><li>Apply a constantly alternating voltage to the crystal.</li><li>Listen to the tiny voltage generated by the crystal's vibration.</li><li>Amplify that signal and feed it back to the crystal.</li></ul><ol><li>The Self-Sustaining Loop (The \"How It Works\"):</li></ol><ul><li>When you power on the circuit, electrical noise provides a tiny, random voltage kick to the crystal.</li><li>The crystal vibrates in response, generating a tiny voltage at its natural resonant frequency.</li><li>The oscillator circuit in the microcontroller picks up this tiny signal, amplifies it, and feeds it back to the crystal.</li><li>This reinforced signal causes the crystal to vibrate more strongly.</li><li>Within a few milliseconds, this feedback loop builds up into a strong, continuous, and perfectly stable oscillation at the crystal's precise natural frequency.</li></ul><p>The result is a clean, square-wave clock signal that drives the entire microcontroller.</p><p><strong>The Complete Picture: The Practical Circuit</strong>\nOn your schematic and PCB, you don't just connect the crystal directly to the MCU. A typical crystal circuit looks like this:</p><div><pre><code>text\n\n         ---||---       ---||---\nOSC1 |---|     |---X---|     |---| OSC2\n     |    C1        |        C2   |\n     |              |             |\n     |-------------/ \\------------|\n                   Rf (Internal)\n</code></pre></div><p>Illustration of a typical crystal oscillator circuit</p><p><strong>Components and Their Roles:</strong></p><ol><li><p>Quartz Crystal (X): The resonant element that sets the frequency.</p></li><li><p>Load Capacitors (C1 and C2): These are absolutely critical.</p></li></ol><ul><li>Purpose: They, along with the crystal's own internal capacitance, form a capacitive load that helps the crystal oscillate at its specified frequency.</li><li>Value: The values (typically 10-22 pF for most MCUs) are chosen to match the crystal's specified load capacitance. Using the wrong values can make the oscillator unstable or cause the frequency to be slightly off.</li></ul><ol><li>Internal Oscillator Circuit (inside MCU): Contains the amplifier and a feedback resistor (Rf), which biases the amplifier into its linear region so it can start and maintain oscillation.</li></ol><p><strong>Why is the Clock Signal So Important?</strong>\nThe clock signal is the \"heartbeat\" of the microcontroller. It synchronizes every operation:</p><ul><li>Core Execution: The CPU executes instructions in time with the clock ticks (each tick is one clock cycle).</li><li>Peripheral Timing: Timers, PWM (Pulse Width Modulation), and communication interfaces like UART, SPI, and I2C all rely on the clock to generate precise baud rates and time intervals.</li><li>Bus Operations: Reading from Flash memory, writing to RAM, and accessing peripherals are all coordinated by the clock.</li></ul><p>A simple analogy: Imagine an orchestra without a conductor. It would be chaotic. The crystal-generated clock signal is the conductor, ensuring every part of the microcontroller works in perfect synchrony.</p><p><strong>The Special 32.768 kHz \"Watch Crystal\"</strong>\nYou often see a second, smaller crystal on boards (shaped like a tiny can). This is almost always a 32.768 kHz crystal.</p><ul><li>Why that number? 32,768 = 2¹⁵.</li><li>A simple 15-stage binary divider circuit can easily divide this frequency down to exactly 1 Hz (one pulse per second), which is perfect for driving a Real-Time Clock (RTC) to keep track of time, even when the main <a href=\"https://www.ampheoelec.de/c/microcontrollers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">microcontroller</a> is in sleep mode.</li></ul><ul><li>It's a resonator: The quartz crystal doesn't create a frequency out of nothing; it <a href=\"https://www.onzuu.com/category/filters\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">filters</a> and stabilizes the oscillation to its precise natural frequency.</li><li>Piezoelectric Effect is key: The mechanical-electrical feedback loop is what makes it work.</li><li>It's a system: The crystal alone won't work. It needs the microcontroller's internal oscillator circuit and the external load capacitors to form a complete, functioning oscillator.</li><li>Precision and Stability: Compared to internal RC oscillators, crystals are vastly more accurate and stable over temperature and voltage changes, which is essential for timing-critical applications and communication protocols.</li></ul>","contentLength":5133,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null}],"tags":["blog"]}
