But these volunteers are increasingly older, with fewer young people signing up than previous decades. Higher cost of living and a diminishing rural population has made volunteering less appealing than it used to be. We interviewed experts in the field of emergency response to figure out how to get those volunteers back, and the answer may be a simple one: pay them for their time. \n\nSupport our work.

Against her husband's wishes, she trains to become a solar technician. In doing so, she initiates a shift in patriarchal traditions.\n\nIn the former Fulbe kingdom of \"Fouta Toro” on the border between Senegal and Mauritania, there are villages so remote that the nearest town is several hours away by car. There is no connection to the electricity grid here. Néné lives in one of these villages. At the market, she heard about an NGO that gives women the opportunity to learn about solar energy. Néné decides to visit the NGO: Her village needs electricity.\n\nBefore Néné, no woman had ever left her village, attended school or learned anything other than how to feed animals, cultivate fields, look after children and prepare food. Néné's husband doesn't want to let her go, but she resists his wishes. She decides to train as a solar technician.\n\nNéné is not alone - other women will be taking part in the training alongside her. As they board the minibus bound for the city, their first step into a new life begins. At the training center, they experience running water and electricity for the first time. The sea and the hustle and bustle of the big city are also new to them.\n\nFour months later, the women return to the village, bringing with them much-desired know-how. They explain how the houses can be supplied with solar energy. Little by little, solar power is finding its way into people's everyday lives. Through their actions and their training, the women subtly raise questions about the meaning of modernity -- and the position of women in society.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #senegal \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Featuring intimate stories and expert voices, the film highlights the struggles and triumphs of caregivers nationwide. \n\nThe two-hour documentary is centered on the personal experiences of caregivers providing for loved ones, and the challenges and triumph they face each day. As the number of caregivers declines, and the number of individuals requiring care in our country increases, the challenges grow. Caregivers require differing types and levels of support. At times, the burdens of caregiving can seem unbearable, regardless of resources. The “needs gap” for information may be greater for caregivers than it is for care recipients. The film will explore these issues and shine a light on innovation for 21st century caregiving.

At a conference, an attendee noticed that my badge said \"architect\" and told me \"I want to be an architect too, but I don't know enough about Kubernetes yet\".\n\nArchitecture, in the systems age, is not (just) Kubernetes. It's not the implementation of any particular toolset. Architecture is designing relationships between parts and adapting those relationship patterns as circumstances change. This requires engaging our mental models and working together to transform them.\n\nThe architecture skillset is socio-technical -- a blend of social and technology skills. It is a way of thinking and communicating. In the modern age, there is no division between the way we think together and the code running in production. Our thinking designs our architecture.\n\nArchitecture is structuring good systems thinking.\n\nIn this talk, I will admit that sometimes architecture is Kubernetes. And share five essential qualities that make a good architect a great architect, regardless of the toolset they employ.

Why does it need extra dimensions? Neil deGrasse Tyson and comedian Chuck Nice welcome theoretical physicist and mathematician Lara Anderson to guide us through string theory, higher dimensions, and finding a unifying theory of everything.\n\nCould it be the long-sought bridge between quantum mechanics and Einstein’s theory of gravity? We explore the problem between relativity and quantum physics, and why things break down when combined. Could strings be the key to unifying these two frameworks? How do strings explain particles? And if they’re so small we can’t detect them, how can we confirm the theory?\n\nHave we reached a fundamental particle yet? Lara walks us through the geometry of hidden additional dimensions and how to get around untestable theories. Learn about the math behind string theory and the vision Chuck had about the dimensionality of the universe. Can you have two time dimensions? Or a compactified time dimension? Discover how there are an infinite number of quantum theories for not our universe and what it means to consider a spherical cow. Can string theory produce the particle physics we see? \n\nWe tackle string theory skepticism, the “string landscape,” and the unexpected discoveries made along the way, like the holographic principle to dualities that link seemingly unrelated theories. What does it mean when two different geometries produce the same physics? And is string theory actually connected to the physics we observe? Can AI help us navigate the math? Plus, we discuss the topology of knots and why you can tie a knot in four dimensions. Could string theory be the gateway to new physics?\nThanks to our Patrons Rachel Burns, GTH, Ali Al-Mubarak, Tinashe Munyaradzi Majada Duma, Lester Hairston, Shelbi Frowein, Daryl Sheppard, Carlos Fernandez, Bryan Skelton, SHONE JOE, Beverly Jo, Dr. Rob Bryan, Mark Swehla Jr, Jake, Jake, Parvaneh Alavi, Caleb Rohrer, Cryosminitar, Joe Oggier, A Tedla, Chris Crisco, Olga, Colby Hyde, Trevor Morrison, Elizabeth P, Adam Haynes, ice age, craig henry, McKenna Lineback, Emily Martinez, Laura V Pagliaro, Tactalpotato750, Raymond Hal Bonnin II, Vladlen Kogan, Matthias Sabourin, Allan Watson, Jimmy Rose, Joe DiRosa, Cal Mathison, Lex Hayes, Quince Poston, Kathleen OBrien, Ryan Enright, Mahi, and Thomas S. for supporting us this week.\n\nTimestamps: \n00:00 - Introduction: Lara Anderson\n03:14 - What is String Theory? \n6:50 - Can We Keep Getting Smaller? \n11:01 - Extra Dimensions Necessary\n17:00 - Can You Test String Theory? \n23:50 - The String Landscape\n27:53 -  Quantum Phenomenology\n29:40 - Discovering the Holographic Principle\n34:00 - Knots in Four Dimensions\n41:16 - Using AI for String Theory\n42:57 - Can String Theory Bring New Physics? \n46:17 - Less Supersymmetry &amp; Celebrating Symmetry\n54:38 - Mirror Symmetry &amp; Calabia Manifolds\n1:00:10 - A Cosmic Perspective\n\n\nCheck out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus\n\nGet the NEW StarTalk book, 'To Infinity and Beyond: A Journey of Cosmic Discovery' on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3PL0NFn\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalk\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

The conflict in Ukraine has shown that warfare is changing. Can the German armed forces keep up?\n\nNew weaponry is being developed: from drones to artificial intelligence and automatic missile defense systems. Germany’s military, the Bundeswehr, is rearming on a large scale while assessing its future priorities. For example, are expensive tanks still suitable for battle when they can be destroyed by cheap drones? And what future role will multi-million-euro fighter planes play?\nAnalysts say that Russia will be in a position to attack NATO territory in five to eight years' time. That’s led high-ranking German military officials to call for the country to be sufficiently armed by 2029. But how realistic is that goal?\n\nAnother concern is the risk of collateral damage caused by the misjudgments of artificial intelligence. Previously, it was hoped that modern weapons like drones would require fewer soldiers on the frontlines. But experts now believe these more complicated weapons will require more maintenance and therefore more personnel. According to military experts, modern warfare will ironically demand more soldiers than before.\n\nHow are Germany, NATO and Russia positioned militarily? Who is spending vast sums on which technologies? And just how much weaponry is actually sensible or justifiable?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #nato \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Our food security is at risk. The United Nations wants to end hunger worldwide by 2030. The advent of Artificial Intelligence could help.\n\nIn Cameroon, Adamou Nchange Kouotou has developed an AI-supported app that farmers can use to scan their crops. This enables them to recognize whether the plants are healthy, find out which pests are present and receive specific instructions for how to combat problems. This AI app already provides direct help to many small farmers who are cultivating depleted soils in the sub-Saharan region.\n\nIn southern Spain, the vegetable garden of Europe, Joaquín Soriano Fernandez relies on sensors to maintain the right temperature and humidity levels in his greenhouses. An algorithm ensures that drought-stricken farmers in the region can irrigate more precisely - and thus save a lot of water.\nIn Madrid, engineer Roemi Fernandez Saavedra is researching new harvesting technologies. Her two-armed harvesting robot can already recognize the shape of ripe tomatoes and eggplants. Her aim is to reduce costs and waste, while freeing people from undignified working conditions.\nOne of the biggest problems we face is food waste. In Germany alone, eleven million tons of food end up in the bin every year. 17 percent of this is produced in restaurants and canteens. That is why a company canteen in Lünen is now using an AI forecasting system that predicts which dishes are most likely to be in demand during the lunch break. \n\nEthical issues are a major hurdle when using AI. Ameca, the world's most advanced humanoid robot, guides us through the film with his assessments: What are the potentials and limits of AI?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #AI \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The most suspicious in this group are often the “Enterprise Architects” who are perceived as being furthest from actual technical problems.\n\nHowever, large-scale IT operation and transformation require transparency across hundreds or thousands of applications running on all sorts of middleware in data centers around the globe. The very enterprise architects are likely the only ones who stand a chance to bring transparency into such an environment and who can direct IT investments in the hundreds of millions of Euros towards modernization and run-cost reduction. This sounds a lot more exciting and valuable than drawing pictures!\n\nThis session takes a serious but light-hearted look at the role of enterprise architects in modern IT organizations. Gregor is a recognized thought leader on asynchronous messaging and service-oriented architectures. He is widely known as co-author of the seminal book “Enterprise Integration Patterns” and as frequent speaker at conferences around the world. He is an active member of the IEEE Software editorial advisory board. He has documented his experience as an architect driving IT transformation in the eBook \"37 Things One Architect Knows\".

The consequences for the civilian population have been devastating. Hundreds of thousands have sought refuge in the remote Nuba Mountains, where there has been less fighting.\n\nFor decades, those living in the Nuba Mountains in southern Sudan were oppressed by the authoritarian regime based in the capital, Khartoum. The remote region still lacks paved roads and mobile phone coverage. Most concerning is the severe shortage of medical facilities.\n\nIn one of the region's few hospitals, a surgeon and his team are working tirelessly to maintain medical care. Since the outbreak of the civil war in April 2023, conditions have deteriorated significantly. The frontlines are nearby, but so far the region has largely been spared from direct fighting. However, like half of Sudan's population, the people here also face the threat of famine.\n\nThe civil war erupted between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), both vying for control of Africa's third-largest country. This power struggle has had devastating effects on the population. Approximately 50 million people live in the country. Around 25 million are currently acutely food insecure, and more than 12 million individuals have been displaced.\n\nThe documentary follows Joseph Yacoub, the director of a hospital, as he navigates his everyday life. He is the only surgeon in the area, and the hospital receives hundreds of patients a day - including women in the late stages of pregnancy, wounded fighters, and mothers with malnourished children. Not all of them can be helped.\n\nJoseph had to learn his surgery skills on the job as there are no universities in the Nuba Mountains He is now passing on his knowledge to Nidal Difan, who aspires to become the first female surgeon in the Nuba Mountains, and Aziz Burma, who is a former soldier. Joseph hopes that one day, these two will carry on with his work. The film sheds light on a seemingly endless war that has left deep scars on the population. The people portrayed are all striving for a future where the war has become a distant memory.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #sudan \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Neil deGrasse Tyson and cohosts Chuck Nice and Gary O’Reilly hang out with astrophysicist Charles Liu to answer questions about the nature of gravity, dark matter, and why we don’t actually know how the solar corona gets hot. \n\nWe explore some of the universe’s deepest mysteries: could dark matter be matter leaking from other dimensions? What happens before black holes collide? And are gravitational waves just the beginning of our understanding of cosmic communication? We break down the known forces in the universe, their corresponding particles, and why gravity is different. Is gravity a force, a curvature, or just semantics? And if gravity is a force, where’s the graviton?\n\nWe spiral into extra dimensions, frame dragging, and why gravity could be the only force that doesn’t respect spacetime boundaries. If gravity could leak from parallel dimensions, what else can? Plus, can we explore Europa’s ocean without contaminating it? Are people rethinking Einstein’s theory in light of new supernova data? We discuss the ethics of ice fishing for alien whales and the enduring lessons of Copernicus.\n\nFinally, what can the Parker Solar Probe teach us about our Sun and other stars beyond? Does the solar corona actually feel that hot? Learn about the unsolved mysteries of the photosphere and why an iceberg has more heat than your morning cup of coffee.

You’ll learn the counter-intuitive concepts hidden in the term and why really using them is so hard. You’ll learn about techniques that will ultimately help you find smaller successful releases, test your ideas faster, develop higher quality software more predictably, and release more confidently than ever before. Because hidden in this nasty little term are clues that can help you do all that.\n\nJeff Patton helps companies adopt a way of working that’s focused on building great products, not just building stuff faster. Jeff blends a mixture of Agile thinking, Lean and Lean Startup Thinking, and UX Design and Design Thinking to end up with a holistic product-centric way of working. Jeff is author of the bestselling O’Reilly book User Story Mapping which describes a simple holistic approach to using stories in Agile development without losing sight of the big picture.

In 2020, the exit took place. Years later, none of the Brexit promises have been kept.\n\nIn the face of a deep economic and social crisis, many Britons now believe that leaving the European Union was a mistake. There is a great deal of anger in society, cutting across all generations. The anger is felt both among those who voted for Brexit, and those who voted to remain in the European Union. \n\nSince the referendum, five prime ministers have resigned in succession -- four of them with a bang --because they were unable to fulfill their populist promises. How did this political chaos come about?\n\nMany Britons are now talking about \"Bregret” -  regret about the exit. The film explores the future of this increasingly divided kingdom. What legacy will former Prime Minister Boris Johnson leave behind? What direction will the country take, in this complex transition period? \n\nFrom initial hope to current regret, this investigation provides a detailed overview of the post-Brexit era in the UK.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #uk #brexit #europe \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

But don't just throw on a chatbot and call it done, as people may not even use it. Let's explore how language models can integrate into your existing web UIs, anticipating your users' needs and completing their tasks faster.\n\nWhile this is a technical, demo-centric talk, it isn't about how LLMs or transformers work internally, nor just how to use Open AI SDKs from a particular language. Instead, it focuses on practical, end-to-end uses for AI in web apps, making your users happier and more productive. [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:15 Useful\n03:58 1.

The birch plays a special role in this boreal coniferous forest. Its light-colored bark forms a perfect insulating layer. Symbiotic fungi protect its roots from attackers.\n\nIn the boreal coniferous forest, where light and darkness, warmth and cold follow each other in an eternal cycle, a sacred tree watches over the inhabitants of the taiga: the birch. With its strong roots and tall crown, this special tree is a symbol of life. The northern Finnish Sami people revere it as a source of inspiration, a resource and a medicinal plant; its wood is used for heating, its bark sap as a medicinal essence and its branches for carving bows. Particularly long-lived trees are treated as oracles, and consulted on existential matters.\n\nThe tree’s light-colored bark blends into the snow-covered landscape in winter, camouflaging the trees and protecting them from foraging hares and reindeer. The white trunk also helps to prevent the snow around the base of the tree from thawing too quickly, thereby protecting its roots from the cold. In summer, it reflects the sunlight and reduces heat absorption on hot days.\n\nLike the birch, other creatures here have also developed strategies to survive under extreme conditions. Lichens are more than just decoration in the boreal coniferous forest: the fungi insulate the soil, and serve as food for reindeer and building material for the nests of Arctic birds. Reindeer, on the other hand, are the landscape gardeners of the taiga: they cut the tasty shoots of ash and larch trees and thus regulate the forest in a natural way. When they roll on the ground, they create small hollows where rainwater can collect; their droppings serve as fertilizer and they transport tree and shrub seeds under their hooves. In the boreal coniferous forest, storms occur frequently throughout the year; the natural flexibility of the birch proves to be an advantage here. Fallen trees also contribute to biodiversity by uncovering mineral soil and exposing it to sunlight so that new life can develop.\n\nBut increasingly extreme summer heatwaves are threatening the fragile ecosystem of the boreal coniferous forest. Animal and plant species must adapt - or migrate further north to escape extinction.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #taiga #tree \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

It is often lauded for its approach to memory safety, particularly through making previously implicit concepts like data ownership explicit. On top of it comes a powerful reference validation system, the borrow checker.\n\nHowever, Rust is often reduced to those two concepts. This talk will give an accessible overview to using Rust core principles - Ownership and Borrowing - together with other, lesser known concepts of the language to build safe and efficient APIs.\n\nFor Rust practicioners, this talk gives insight into known concepts in more detail. It does so by looking at examples from the Rust standard library first and foremost. For people who don't practice Rust regularly, it gives an insight into properties of the language that are less spoken about.

Neil deGrasse Tyson and comedian Chuck Nice tackle your cosmic questions, from the Silurian Hypothesis to singularities to the edge of the known universe. \n\nWe ponder the relationship between time and motion. Does all time require motion, or can it exist on its own? Can you measure time without something that repeats?  Then, Neil sheepishly recommends a book every 12-year-old should read (yes, it’s his). Plus, what would the universe look like from its edge? What lies beyond our cosmic horizon, and could we ever see it? \n\nWe explore the Silurian Hypothesis and whether a pre-human civilization might be forever lost under Earth’s shifting crust. If an intelligent species lived on Earth millions of years before us, would we even know? Chuck recalls a certain dinosaur sitcom, while Neil considers how crustal subduction buries geological records. What’s the timescale for Earth’s crust to recycle every trace of a lost civilization? Then it’s off to black holes: Is the singularity at the heart of a black hole real, or just a mathematical glitch?\n\nFrom there, we shine light on why some materials are transparent and whether mining the Moon could affect Earth. We break down how light behaves at the atomic level—what makes some materials transparent while others blur or block? Would mining the Moon make it lighter? And if the Moon vanished, would tides survive? We debate renaming time itself, dream up wormholes in the kitchen, and figure out how massless photons still carry images. Finally, what if our whole universe is inside a black hole? Could each black hole house a universe of its own?

Are we becoming desensitized to this constant stream of bad news? And could that actually be necessary to help us stay functional amid global conflict and the climate crisis?\n\nAre we growing emotionally numb to relentless negative headlines? Or is this emotional distance essential to keeping our survival instincts intact? \n\nThe human organism is equipped to handle negative stimuli, explains neurophysiologist Ursula Koch. In Amsterdam, communication scientist Dominique Wirz studies how emotions are processed depending on the intensity and frequency of media consumption. Meanwhile, frontline workers at Doctors Without Borders often manage high-stress situations more effectively than passive \"doomscrollers\" overwhelmed by the news cycle.\n\nHow can we respond more constructively to distressing news? And why are members of the \"Psychologists for Future” movement calling for strategies to help us cope with alarming climate reports?\n\nIn this documentary, filmmaker Sören Senn - a self-confessed bad news addict - investigates how his own media habits affect his mental state and explores how we might rethink the way we consume difficult news stories.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

But many people oppose them and are fighting to defend democracy. Where do they find the courage to stand up to this sometimes-violent milieu?\n\nRight-wing extremists are stronger than ever. In cities, the counter movement is strong and highly visible. But in more rural areas, anyone openly opposing the far right often has to reckon with threats and attempts at intimidation. A film team accompanied just some of the individuals whose resistance puts them at great personal risk.\n\nOcean Hale campaigns against the right in rural Saxony. In contrast to the demonstrations that take place in large cities such as Dresden and Leipzig, demonstrations in favor of a tolerant and diverse Germany are relatively small here. Most people either march openly on the opposite side or keep their political views to themselves. But Ocean isn’t afraid to show his face. He’s already organized two Christopher Street Days in the small town of Waldheim, and isn’t deterred by death threats and acid attacks.\n\nMagdalena has launched the #ReclaimTikTok initiative. Together with others, she produces as much content as possible, all under the label: tolerant and anti-fascist. The campaign has already caught the attention of far-right activist Martin Sellner. Since her real name has been shared on various right-wing social media channels, Magdalena is also having to take greater care as she goes about her everyday life.\n\nJacob is an independent blogger and photographer in Gera, Thuringia. Whenever members of the Reichsbürger (Reich Citizens) movement gather from all over Germany for demonstrations in his hometown, he reports from crowd. Jacob thinks many people are irritated by these regular far-right rallies in Gera, but that they’re afraid to speak out. His aim: to document and inform, in order to increase public awareness.\n\nOcean, Magdalena, Jacob - they’re all taking personal risks and sacrificing their free time and anonymity to stand up for an open-minded society. What drives them? Where do they find their courage, when things get risky?\n\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

We don’t really pay attention to the data itself, especially when we have terabytes or petabytes of it.\n\nHuge mistake. And we are trained to make it! It is why it takes a year for a new programmer to be productive at working on the #GoogleRanking algorithm. It held back progress on genome #SequencingAlgorithms. It has cost me more time than I’d care to imagine.\n\nThe good news is that you don’t have to look at all of your petabytes of data. Just eyeball a ten record sample when you start, and repeat as you work the data. Even then, eyeballing can be hard work, and done wrong can be worse than doing nothing. But done right, it can be fun, and the data will almost always surprise you. Better yet, you can use your favorite algorithms and architectures to build tools to make eyeballing your data easier and much more effective.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nKevlin Henney • 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know • https://amzn.to/2Yahf9U\nHenney &amp; Monson-Haefel • 97 Things Every Software Architect Should Know • https://amzn.to/3pZuHsQ\nMatthew Skelton &amp; Manuel Pais • Team Topologies • http://amzn.to/3sVLyLQ\nMichael Jackson • Software Requirements and Specifications • https://amzn.to/3ql2T14\nGeoffrey West • Scale • http://amzn.to/3eKMbpc\nDonald G.

To put that in context, Texas alone has seen 25 hospital closures since 2005. If nothing is done, the state could lose over half the remaining small town hospitals. That means people are driving further for care, sometimes over an hour, or waiting longer to get help. These delays could lead to worse health outcomes. \n\nNationwide, an estimated 20% of the US population lives in rural areas. Other estimates found that 80% of counties across the US lack adequate access to health care. Unlike their urban counterparts, small town hospitals are often the entire health care system for the community, meaning they provide a wide range of services from lab tests and screening to basic primary care. When one shuts down, it means the surrounding community could lose access to all health care. There is bipartisan support to assist rural communities, and Congress has passed a number of bills over the decades to try to keep these facilities open, but it still isn’t enough. So why are so many rural hospitals shutting down?\n\nIt’s a multifaceted issue that comes back again and again to income. At its core, a hospital is a business and, often, not a very lucrative one. One recent report found that over 50% of rural hospitals are operating at a deficit. The slightest change in income could be the difference between staying open and having to shut their doors for good.

To curb this corruption, puritanical reformers advocated for foods they thought curbed a variety of appetites.

What is known about the brutal system of detention, torture and killing under which they disappeared?\n\n“Syria’s Detainee Files” documents the search for answers and accountability, shedding new light on atrocities under Assad through stunning testimony of former regime insiders and officers who carried them out, alongside the accounts of people who survived them.\n\nThe documentary follows Shadi and Hadi Haroun, two brothers who survived torture and almost a decade of imprisonment. Shadi says, “I lost 10 years of my life because of someone’s decision. Simply, ‘Erase ten years of his life, from the smallest moments to the most important ones.’”\n\nThe film explores how many former officials — some of whom defected, and some of whom stayed loyal to the regime until the end — rationalize their actions, saying they were following the orders of a government that would have killed them otherwise.\n\nNow that the Assad regime has fallen and there are calls for accountability, the film raises questions about who, in a vast system of people following orders, should be held responsible for the atrocities.\n\n“Syria’s Detainee Files” is a BBC Current Affairs production for GBH/FRONTLINE and BBC.

We discuss how Edwin Hubble spotted Cepheid variables and shattered the idea that the Milky Way was the entire universe. Discover how Henrietta Leavitt's data, Georges Lemaître’s math, and Einstein’s “cosmological constant” all collided in a revolutionary era that gave birth to expansion.\n\nAs the universe expanded, so did our questions. Was there a beginning? What happened at time zero? The Big Bang theory emerged, colliding with the idea that the universe is in a steady state, and intrigued members of the clergy. What is quantum mechanics really telling us about reality? Why did the idea of a beginning disturb scientists? And how do wave functions, tunneling, and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle reshape reality?\n\nPlus: Why do we think the universe has three dimensions? Could dark energy be spillover from other dimensions? And how do relativity and quantum mechanics still refuse to play nice?

Those unlucky people who tragically crossed Burke and Hare’s murderous path were targeted because of their isolation… but there was always more to their stories… \n\nThe murders could only go on for so long… and Burke and Hare’s downfall, trial and the public execution of Burke caused a media storm. The killings made headlines and haunted the public in Edinburgh and across the world. \n\nAnthony and Maddy consider the unanswered questions of the case: how much did flamboyant Doctor Knox, who bought the bodies, know about where they had come from, how complicit were the men’s partners in their crimes… and what happened to William Hare. \n\nDiscover the past on History Hit with ad-free exclusive podcasts and documentaries released weekly presented by world renowned historians Dan Snow, Suzannah Lipscomb, Lucy Worsely, Mary Beard and more.

Low taxes. Free markets. Deregulation. Those have been the buzzwords for more than half a century. But that doctrine is now being challenged by other conservatives who envision a future in which America’s trade deficit is lower, manufacturing returns to the US, and Americans buy more American-made products.\nIs this future even possible?\n\nEconomist Oren Cass thinks it is. In today’s episode, the founder of the think tank America Compass speaks to Sean about right-wing economic populism. The two discuss a conservative, pro-worker approach to economic policy, Cass’s plan to bring manufacturing back to the US, and what types of behavior economic policy should incentivize.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Neil deGrasse Tyson, Chuck Nice, and Gary O’Reilly learn about Nobel-prize-winning Alphafold, the protein folding problem, and how solving it could end disease with AI researcher and Chief AI Officer of Isomorphic Labs, Max Jaderberg. \n\nWe break down the protein folding problem and why it was so hard to crack. How do we learn to decode how strings of amino acids fold into complex, dynamic shapes that power our biology? How did AlphaFold crack this decades-old puzzle? We explore how Alphafold 3 uses the shapes of proteins to predict protein-drug interactions. How close are we to using AI and deep learning to design new medicines instead of discovering them by chance? Could generative AI invent molecules that precisely target the cause of a disease?\n\nWe take these ideas into the future: Could AI help us fix misfolded proteins that cause illness? Can we use these tools to create personalized drugs tailored to your unique genome? Will it make it economically feasible to treat rare diseases? Could this even help us slow aging or regenerate limbs, like salamanders do? Could this technology combat cancer, fix rare genetic disorders, or even digest plastic? And with quantum computing on the horizon, what happens when we combine it with AI? Will chemistry ever be done the same way again?\n\nThanks to our Patrons Riley r, pesketti, Lindsay Vanlerberg, Andreas, Silvia Valentine, Brazen Rigsby, Marc, Lyda Swanston, Kevin Henry, Roberto Reyes, Cadexn, Cassandra Shanklin, Stan Adamson, Will Slade, Zach VanderGraaff, Tom Spalango, Laticia Edmonds, jason scott, Jigar Gada, Robert Jensen, Matt D., TOL, Thomas McDaniel, Sr., Ryan Ramsey, truthmind, Aaron TInker, George Assaf, Dante Ruzinok, Jonathan Ford, Just Ernst, David Eli Janes, Tamil, Sarah, Earnest Lee, Craig Hanson, Rob, Be Love, Brandon Wilson, TJ Kellysawyer, Bodhi Animations, Dave P., Christina Williams, Ivaylo Vartigorov, Roy Mitsuoka (@surflightroy), John Brendel, Moises Zorrilla, deborah shaw, Jim Muoio, Tahj Ward, Phil, Alex, Brian D.

It is a region full of evidence of the connections early Christians made here with places and events in the Bible, from Moses to the baptism of Jesus.\n\nThe journey begins overlooking the Jordan Valley on Mount Nebo, the site of the death of Moses and a place of pilgrimage for centuries.\ne\nNear Mount Nebo, at Madaba, Dan discovers one of the most extraordinary maps of the ancient world, created by the Christian community here in the 5th century AD. It is a spectacular layout of the Holy Land and the world as these early Christians saw it, from Egypt to Lebanon, including a detailed representation of Jerusalem with the Church of the Holy Sepulchre at its heart. \n\nTravelling to the banks of the River Jordan itself, Dan then encounters archaeological discoveries revealing the veneration of this place’s association with Elijah and John the Baptist for centuries. This is believed to be Bethany Beyond the Jordan, a location where faith and history coincide as excavations have uncovered 5th century AD buildings commemorating the spot where early Christians believed John baptised Jesus and where His ministry began.\n\nThis is a fascinating journey into the past and the powerful connections made between faith and real places on the ground for millennia.\n\nThere is more information about the Baptism Site here:\n\nhttps://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1446/\n\nhttps://www.baptismsite.com/books/BaptismSite_WhitePaper.pdf\n\nTo find out more about Jordan, visit: https://visitjordan.com/\n\nDiscover the past on History Hit with ad-free exclusive podcasts and documentaries released weekly presented by world renowned historians Dan Snow, Suzannah Lipscomb, Lucy Worsely, Mary Beard and more.

It is so relentless that our best defense is to drop 100 million radiation-blasted, flesh-eating flies from the sky – every week.\nIt’s one of the most successful biological campaigns in history, but it’s a war we can never stop fighting… and one we can’t afford to lose.\n\n\nOUR CHANNELS\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nGerman:        https://kgs.link/youtubeDE\nSpanish:        https://kgs.link/youtubeES\nFrench:          https://kgs.link/youtubeFR\nPortuguese:  https://kgs.link/youtubePT\nArabic:           https://kgs.link/youtubeAR\nHindi:             https://kgs.link/youtubeHI\nJapanese:     https://kgs.link/youtubeJA\nKorean:          https://kgs.link/youtubeKO\n\n\nHOW CAN YOU SUPPORT US?\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThis is how we make our living and it would be a pleasure if you support us!\n\nGet Products designed with ❤️ https://shop.kgs.link\nJoin the Patreon Bird Army 🐧  https://kgs.link/patreon  \n\n\nDISCUSSIONS &amp; SOCIAL MEDIA\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nInstagram:     https://kgs.link/instagram\nTikTok:           https://kgs.link/tiktok\nReddit:            https://kgs.link/reddit\nDiscord:          https://kgs.link/discord\nTwitter:           https://kgs.link/twitter\nBluesky:          https://kgs.link/bluesky\nFacebook:      https://kgs.link/facebook\nNewsletter:    https://kgs.link/newsletter\n\n\nOUR VOICE\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThe kurzgesagt voice is from \nSteve Taylor:  https://kgs.link/youtube-voice\n\n\nOUR MUSIC ♬♪\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\n700+ minutes of kurzgesagt soundtracks by Epic Mountain:\n\nSpotify:            https://kgs.link/music-spotify\nSoundcloud:   https://kgs.link/music-soundcloud\nBandcamp:     https://kgs.link/music-bandcamp\nYoutube:          https://kgs.link/music-youtube\nFacebook:       https://kgs.link/music-facebook\n\nThe soundtrack of this video:\nSoundCloud: https://bit.ly/3ZESsr6\nBandcamp: https://bit.ly/43LKTQF\n\nIf you want to help us caption this video, please send subtitles to subtitle@kurzgesagt.org\nYou can find info on what subtitle files work on YouTube here:\nhttps://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734698?hl=en-GB&amp;ref_topic=7296214\nThank you!\n\n\n🐦🐧🐤 PATREON BIRD ARMY 🐤🐧🐦\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nMany thanks to our wonderful Patreons (from http://kgs.link/patreon) who support us every month and made this video possible:\nNooby3555, Jasmine Blanch, Ternich, Karel,Hayk Shahparonyan, jjktard, QVH, Julian Truniger, Bad Tanker, Max Ganaa, Business Goose, Ruben Grudzus, Feigel family, FJ, Esinam Bediako,Bruhnabis, Bernice Chen, Alex Salinero, Winthace, Jakob Shuey, One Point, xvskulblaka7, Logan Larson\n\n\nCHAPTERS\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\n0:00 Start\n2:30 Skip The \"Fun\" Part</article>","contentLength":3619,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/zxq60I5RSW8?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How the US created an ambulance crisis","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWRlDIBoQW4","date":1748952077,"author":"Vox","guid":36,"unread":true,"content":"<article>And what can be done about it.\n\nThanks to our sponsor, T-Mobile: http://t-mobile.com/FirstResponders\n\nHere's a pretty obvious statement: In the more rural, spread-out parts of the US, an ambulance will typically take a while to get to you. Makes sense. Driving a longer distance takes longer.\n\nHere's the catch: other emergency services like police and fire don't actually have this same problem; it's relatively unique to ambulances. It turns out that emergency response time is about a little more than distance. Something is different about ambulances that is slowing them down in rural areas of the US.\n\nThat difference starts with the ways that ambulance services are funded in most of the US: Instead of being paid for by taxes like police and fire services are, ambulances are often paid for by a sort of a la carte model — the more people they take to the hospital, the more they get reimbursed. It's a model that works well for emergency services in densely populated areas, but less well for everyone else. In this video, we look at how exactly that translates into longer response times, and what can be done to fix it.\n\nNote: A previous version of this video contained an incorrect graphic at 6:00. The graphic has been removed.\n\nFurther reading:\nYvonne’s paper about Ambulance deserts: https://digitalcommons.usm.maine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1013&amp;context=ems \n\nEmergency response time compared in rural, urban, and suburban areas: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5831456/\n\nHistory of EMS: https://indianahealth.care/history-of-ems \n\nAmbulance billing explained (for Boston, but speaks to more general billing as well): https://www.boston.gov/departments/emergency-medical-services/ambulance-bill-frequently-asked-questions\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.
