Johannes (<a href=\"https://github.com/straight-shoota\">@straight-shoota</a>) will be taking on the leading role of the project. Please join me in congratulating him on his new position!</p><p>While this might sound like a big change, in reality it isn’t: over the past year I’ve already been a bit distant from the project due to Manas’ own dynamics. Yet, Johannes and Julien have kept this tight ship on course, with just a bit of extra help. In essence, Johannes has already been a de facto leader.</p><p>As for myself, I will be leading the Theory of Computation group at <a href=\"https://www.ort.edu.uy/\">ORT University</a>, returning to my other passions: teaching and research. Who knows, maybe I will finally get to do some cool research in Crystal!</p><p>This change marks the end of an amazing journey that began four years ago, leading an equally amazing group of people; building this amazing language we all love. I’m deeply grateful to Manas, the Core Team, and the Crystal community at large. The learnings that I gather will accompany me for the rest of my life. You’re wonderful!</p>","contentLength":1132,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null}],"tags":["official"]}
