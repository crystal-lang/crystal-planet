She is suspected of photographing military facilities and unlawfully entering restricted areas.</p></div><div><p>Estonian news portal <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.delfi.ee/artikkel/120386662/rootsis-vahistati-eesti-kodanik-kes-pildistas-riigi-uht-koige-salajasemat-sojavaebaasi\">Delfi reports</a>, that during a preliminary hearing in Huddinge on June 24, Zaira was formally charged under Swedish laws prohibiting unauthorized photography and access to protected sites. Prosecutor Julia Tibäck told Swedish newspaper Expressen that base guards spotted Zaira taking photos with her phone, prompting them to alert the police.</p></div><div><p>Authorities currently have no evidence linking Zaira to any foreign intelligence service.</p></div><div><p>At the hearing, Zaira admitted to entering the area and taking pictures but denied any criminal intent or gross negligence. She also challenged the necessity of her detention, calling it disproportionate.</p></div><div><p>Zaira will remain in custody until trial. Prosecutor Tibäck justified the detention by citing flight risk: Zaira is not a Swedish citizen and doesn’t reside in the country. While again noting no espionage link, Tibäck acknowledged concerns were heightened due to Zaira’s foreign citizenship.</p></div><div><p>Zaira’s lawyer, Sanna Älgekrans, said her client was shocked by the arrest and didn’t expect such serious consequences. Asked whether Zaira’s nationality may have influenced suspicions, Älgekrans replied, “Yes, clearly. The current climate likely played a role.”</p></div><div><p>However, she stopped short of calling it discrimination. She declined to reveal what exactly appeared in Zaira’s photographs, citing confidentiality.</p></div><div><p>Zaira reportedly works as an engineer near Tallinn and has long been active in endurance and adventure sports. Her social media shows she attended high school in the former Kazakh SSR and studied at Leningrad Polytechnic. Her next court hearing is scheduled for no later than the morning of July 1.</p></div>","contentLength":1902,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1lkscx3/estonian_national_arrested_near_swedish_naval/"},{"title":"UK to Build Six New Factories for Artillery Shell Production","url":"https://militarnyi.com/en/news/uk-to-build-six-new-factories-for-artillery-shell-production/","date":1750877905,"author":"/u/Straight_Ad2258","guid":415,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Підтримати нас можна через:  </p>","contentLength":52,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1lkeag7/uk_to_build_six_new_factories_for_artillery_shell/"},{"title":"Ukrainian soldier used a Pringles can to blow up a Russian tank","url":"https://euromaidanpress.com/2025/06/25/ukraine-pringles-can-drone-bomb/","date":1750877773,"author":"/u/Straight_Ad2258","guid":414,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1lke8g3/ukrainian_soldier_used_a_pringles_can_to_blow_up/"},{"title":"Trump considers more Patriots for Ukraine, says Putin \"has to end\" the war","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiy-hails-substantive-meeting-with-trump-2025-06-25/","date":1750877611,"author":"/u/Straight_Ad2258","guid":419,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1lke5uo/trump_considers_more_patriots_for_ukraine_says/"}],"tags":["news","reddit"]}
