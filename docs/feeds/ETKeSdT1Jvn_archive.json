Firms are increasing efforts to mitigate risks associated with LLMs regarding sensitive data exfiltration of personally identifiable information and sensitive company data. The primary mitigation strategy is to build guardrails around Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to safeguard data while also optimizing query response quality and efficiency. \n\nTo enable precise guardrails, one must implement permissions systems with advanced fine grained authorization capabilities such as returning lists of authorized subjects and accessible resources. Such systems ensure that LLMs can access only authorized data while preventing exfiltration of sensitive information, making RAGs more efficient and improving performance at scale. \n\nThis session will cover how modern permissions systems can safeguard sensitive data in RAG pipelines. We'll start with why Authorization is critical for RAG pipelines to protect sensitive data from potential vulnerabilities and also the various techniques for permissions-aware data retrieval. The talk will also include a practical demo implementing fine-grained authorization for RAG using Pinecone, Langchain, OpenAI, and SpiceDB - an Open Source authorization database.\n---\n\nFull schedule, including slides and other resources: \nhttps://pretalx.devconf.info/devconf-cz-2025/schedule/</article>","contentLength":1539,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/aeace8MDlhk?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"SRE'ing the SRE AI Agents - DevConf.CZ 2025","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz_0TDzJD_U","date":1750926018,"author":"DevConf","guid":619,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Speaker(s): Boran SEREF\n\nSo, you’ve got a new colleague: an AI agent. It doesn’t need coffee breaks, doesn’t complain about on-call schedules, and (so it claims) can debug faster than you. Sounds perfect, right? Well, until it starts spamming Slack at 3 AM or, worse, decides it has production access opinions.\n\nIn this session, we’ll dive into the chaotic, glorious reality of managing AI agents as part of your SRE team. We’ll tackle the tough questions: How do you assign permissions to something that thinks it’s always right? How do you monitor and log what your robot coworker is doing (and why it thought deleting all your service accounts was a good idea)? And most importantly, how do you keep it from going rogue and bringing down prod on a Friday night?\n\nWith a mix of traditional SRE practices and new strategies tailored for AI agents, we’ll explore how to establish trust, maintain control, and avoid turning your AI into an unmanageable production liability.

This talk demonstrates how Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP) simplify LLM data processing with flexibility, repeatability, and scalability. These pipelines are being used daily at IBM Research to build indemnified LLMs tailored for enterprise applications.\nDifferent data preparation toolkits are built on Kubernetes, Rust, Slurm, or Spark. How would you choose one for your own LLM experiments or enterprise use cases and why should you consider Kubernetes and KFP?\nThis talk describes how open source Data Prep Toolkit leverages KFP and KubeRay for scalable pipeline orchestration, e.g. deduplication, content classification, and tokenization.\nWe share challenges, lessons, and insights from our experience with KFP, highlighting its applicability for diverse LLM tasks, such as data preprocessing, RAG retrieval, and model fine-tuning.\n---\n\nFull schedule, including slides and other resources: \nhttps://pretalx.devconf.info/devconf-cz-2025/schedule/</article>","contentLength":1139,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/iyu_yggCNmk?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"All you wanted to know about sw vulnerabilities…but were too busy to look into - DevConf.CZ 2025","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJg563yF2yc","date":1750925839,"author":"DevConf","guid":615,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Speaker(s): Dejan Bosanac\n\nVulnerability discovery is one of the crucial aspects of software supply chain security.

Where is all the data coming from? What are the formats in which data is exchanged? We will dig into the world of CVEs and VEXs (Vulnerability exchange) and show how efforts like the OSV (Open Source Vulnerability) database help us keep safe.

But one of the biggest challenges facing businesses today, that I particularly care about, is how to unlock the true potential of AI by leveraging a company’s operational business data. At Snow Leopard, we aim to bridge the gap between AI systems and critical business data that is locked away in databases, data warehouses, and other API-based systems, so enterprises can use live business data from any data source – whether it's database, warehouse, or APIs – in real time and on demand, natively. In this interview, I'd like to cover Snow Leopard’s intelligent data retrieval approach that can leverage business data directly and on-demand to make AI work.</p><p>Deepti is the founder and CEO of Snow Leopard AI, a platform that helps teams build AI apps using their live business data, on-demand. She has nearly 2 decades of experience in data platforms and infrastructure.</p><p>As Head of Product at Observable, Deepti led the 0→1 product and GTM strategy in the crowded data analytics market. Before that, Deepti was the founding PM for Google Spanner, growing it to thousands of internal customers (Ads, PlayStore, Gmail, etc.), before launching it externally as a seminal cloud database service. Deepti started her career as a distributed systems engineer in the RAC database kernel at Oracle.</p><p>Website: https://www.snowleopard.ai/</p><p>AI SQL Data Analyst // Donné Stevenson - https://youtu.be/hwgoNmyCGhQ</p><p>~~~~~~~~ ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ ~~~~~~~</p><p>Catch all episodes, blogs, newsletters, and more: https://go.mlops.community/TYExplore</p><p>Join our Slack community [https://go.mlops.community/slack]</p><p>Follow us on X/Twitter [@mlopscommunity](https://x.com/mlopscommunity) or [LinkedIn](https://go.mlops.community/linkedin)] </p><p>Sign up for the next meetup: [https://go.mlops.community/register]</p><p>MLOps Swag/Merch: [https://shop.mlops.community/]</p><p>Connect with Demetrios on LinkedIn: /dpbrinkm</p><p>Connect with Deepti on LinkedIn: /thedeepti/</p><p>[00:00] Deepti's preferred coffee</p><p>[00:49] MLflow vs Kubeflow Debate</p><p>[04:58] GenAI Data Integration Challenges</p><p>[09:02] GenAI Sidecar Spicy Takes</p><p>[14:07] Troubleshooting LLM Hallucinations</p><p>[19:03] AI Overengineering and Hype</p><p>[25:06] Self-Serve Analytics Governance</p><p>[33:29] Dashboards vs Data Quality</p><p>[37:06] Agent Database Context Control</p><p>[43:00] LLM as Orchestrator</p><p>[47:34] Tool Call Ownership Clarification</p><p>[51:45] MCP Server Challenges</p>","contentLength":2798,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/104409155/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2025-5-20%2F402521359-44100-2-6945f69f5f792.mp3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The Mysteries of Easter Island","url":"https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/the-mysteries-of-easter-island","date":1750375800,"author":"","guid":473,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In the heart of the Pacific Ocean, over 2,000 miles from the nearest continent, lies one of the world’s most iconic archaeological treasure troves - Rapa Nui, known to the outside world as Easter Island.

Rauff was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people during the Second World War and was a key perpetrator of the Holocaust. After escaping to Chile, he would eventually come to work for the brutal Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. There he would go on to inflict further miseries on the Chilean people.
