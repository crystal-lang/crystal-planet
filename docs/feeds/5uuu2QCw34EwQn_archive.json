That was well ahead of the $9.89 billion average analyst estimate, sending the shares up in late trading.&nbsp; Micron is seeing increasing demand for components like its high-bandwidth memory, which are used in machines that develop and run AI tools. The company expects continued growth from that market as such software becomes more complex, requiring bigger amounts of memory. The company is also starting to recover from narrower profit margins in the previous quarter.\n--------\nWatch Bloomberg Radio LIVE on YouTube\nWeekdays 7am-6pm ET\nWATCH HERE: http://bit.ly/3vTiACF\n \nFollow us on X: https://twitter.com/BloombergRadio\n\nSubscribe to our Podcasts:\n\n    Bloomberg Daybreak: http://bit.ly/3DWYoAN\n    Bloomberg Surveillance: http://bit.ly/3OPtReI\n    Bloomberg Intelligence: http://bit.ly/3YrBfOi\n    Balance of Power: http://bit.ly/3OO8eLC\n    Bloomberg Businessweek: http://bit.ly/3IPl60i\n\nListen on Apple CarPlay and Android Auto with the Bloomberg Business app:\nApple CarPlay: https://apple.co/486mghI\nAndroid Auto: https://bit.ly/49benZy\n \nVisit our YouTube channels:\nBloomberg Podcasts: https://www.youtube.com/bloombergpodcasts\nBloomberg Television: https://www.youtube.com/@markets\nBloomberg Originals: https://www.youtube.com/bloomberg\nQuicktake: https://www.youtube.com/@BloombergQuicktake</article>","contentLength":1584,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/LqrvSEsNb9c?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"LIVE: Bezos wedding guests depart hotel for celebrations","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okt0hYO8Adc","date":1750962057,"author":"Reuters","guid":500,"unread":true,"content":"<article>A view of the hotel in Venice, Italy, where Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and journalist Lauren Sanchez's wedding guests are expected to depart for an event marking the start of three days of celebrations.\n \n#wedding #venice #italy #jeffbezos #laurensanchez\n\nKeep up with the latest news from around the world: https://www.reuters.com/</article>","contentLength":331,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/okt0hYO8Adc?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Axiom mission arrives at International Space Station | REUTERS","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAp7raRIBKI","date":1750961786,"author":"Reuters","guid":499,"unread":true,"content":"<article>The four-person crew of Axiom Mission 4, which includes Shubhanshu Shukla of India, Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski of Poland, and Tibor Kapu of Hungary, docked at the International Space Station\n#News #Reuters #Newsfeed #axiommission4 #axiomspace #spacemission  #spacex \n\nRead the story here: https://reut.rs/4kURnnH\n\nüëâ  Subscribe: http://smarturl.it/reuterssubscribe\n\nKeep up with the latest news from around the world: https://www.reuters.com/\nFollow Reuters on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/reuters/?hl=en</article>","contentLength":631,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/eAp7raRIBKI?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Crypto Weekly: New app to new ban | REUTERS","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laVbG1zs32A","date":1750960506,"author":"Reuters","guid":498,"unread":true,"content":"<article>From World Liberty Financial's latest plans to why Norway is seeking to ban new crypto mining centers, here are some of the big crypto stories of the week.\n#crypto #norway #fintech #finance #News #Reuters #Newsfeed \n\nüëâ  Subscribe: http://smarturl.it/reuterssubscribe\n\nKeep up with the latest news from around the world: https://www.reuters.com/\nFollow Reuters on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/reuters/?hl=en</article>","contentLength":533,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/laVbG1zs32A?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"LIVE: State Department briefing","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOrUTEFTrwQ","date":1750960376,"author":"Reuters","guid":501,"unread":true,"content":"<article>State Department deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott holds a briefing after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said he was unaware of any intelligence suggesting Iran moved any of its highly enriched uranium to shield it from U.S. strikes over the weekend.

production, seizures and use all hit record highs in 2023, the UN drug agency said, with the illicit drug's market the world's fastest-growing.</p><p>Illegal production jumped to 3,708 tonnes, nearly 34% more than in 2022, and more than four times higher than ten years earlier, when it was at a low, the Vienna-based UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said in its annual report.</p><p>The current surge is mainly due to an increase in the size of the area under illicit coca bush cultivation in Colombia and updated yield data, it added.</p><p>Global cocaine seizures, too, recorded a high of 2,275 tonnes, marking a 68% rise in the four years to 2023.</p><p>The number of cocaine users also grew to 25 million in 2023, up from 17 million, ten years earlier.</p><p>\"Cocaine has become fashionable for the more affluent society,\" UNODC chief researcher Angela Me said, noting a \"vicious cycle\" of increased use and production.</p><p>While Colombia remains the key producer, cocaine traffickers are breaking into new markets across Asia and Africa, according to the report, with organised crime groups from the Western Balkans increasing their influence.</p><p>\"North America, Western and Central Europe and South America continue to constitute the largest markets for cocaine, on the basis of the number of people who used drugs in the past year and on data derived from wastewater analysis.</p><p>\"A new era of global instability has intensified challenges in addressing the world drug problem, empowering organised crime groups and pushing drug use to historically high levels,\" UNODC noted.</p><p>In 2023, the percent of the people aged between 15 and 64 estimated to have used a drug was 6%, compared to 5.2% of the population in 2013.</p><p>Cannabis remains the most widely used drug.</p><p>Seizures of amphetamine-type stimulants reached a record high in 2023, making up almost half of all global seizures of synthetic drugs, followed by synthetic opioids, including fentanyl, UNODC said.</p><p>The leading drugs there were methamphetamine and amphetamine.</p><p>The fall of ruler Bashar al-Assad in Syria last December has \"created uncertainty around the future of the captagon trade\", UNODC added.</p><p>Earlier this month, Syria said authorities had seized all production facilities of the illicit stimulant, which became Syria's largest export under the Assad regime.</p><p>\"The latest seizure data from 2024 and 2025 confirm that captagon is continuing to flow - primarily to countries of the Arabian peninsula - possibly indicating the release of previously-accumulated stockpiles or continued production in different locations,\" UNODC

Their meeting, along with others involving Russian intelligence chief Sergey Naryshkin and Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, signaled more than symbolic alignment. Outside Russia‚Äôs Foreign Intelligence Service headquarters, Blaha declared, ‚Äú<i>Slovaks and Russians are brothers</i>,‚Äù and described NATO as an aggressive force at fault for the war in Ukraine.</p><p>Blaha‚Äôs language mirrored standard Kremlin narratives, but his platform gave them an unusual level of legitimacy within a European Union member state. In Moscow, he posed for photos, praised Russian strength, and publicly called for ‚ÄúSlovak-Russian friendship,‚Äù even as Russian forces continued their invasion of Ukraine and targeted civilian infrastructure.</p><p>But it is not only public posturing that alarms observers. The VSquare report points to deeper concerns within the Slovak political system. One of Prime Minister Robert Fico‚Äôs key advisors, David Lindtner, is reportedly acting as an informal liaison between senior Slovak officials and Moscow-aligned actors. Lindtner, who has no public mandate in foreign affairs, has been described by national security sources as part of a ‚Äúsilent corridor‚Äù through which the Kremlin maintains influence over parts of the Slovak state.</p><p>Slutsky, a longtime figure in Kremlin diplomacy, has increasingly positioned himself as a bridge to fringe European figures willing to echo Russia‚Äôs preferred narratives. From German AfD leaders to French extremists, and now to Slovak officials, his pattern is clear: elevate allies who reject Western consensus and spread disinformation under the guise of diplomacy.</p><p>What makes the Slovak case especially dangerous, according to VSquare, is the normalization of these contacts. Unlike past far-right alliances with Moscow that existed outside power structures, SMER and its partners currently govern Slovakia. That means access to state intelligence, foreign policy briefings, and European decision-making channels.</p><p>The strategy is subtle but effective: turn EU member states into vectors for Kremlin narratives, and weaponize internal politics to splinter European resolve.</p><p>With Blaha amplifying Russian propaganda at home and Fico‚Äôs advisors engaging in opaque diplomacy abroad, Slovakia risks becoming a Trojan horse inside the European Union.</p><p>The VSquare report ends with a warning‚Äîthis is not just about Slovakia. It is a case study in how Russian intelligence co-opts democratic institutions using ideology, relationships, and deniable influence. And unless it is confronted with transparency and resolve, it will not stop at Bratislava.</p>","contentLength":2776,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1lkvnki/putins_henchmen_now_deeply_ingrained_at_highest/"},{"title":"Erdogan and Macron meeting moments at the NATO summit.
