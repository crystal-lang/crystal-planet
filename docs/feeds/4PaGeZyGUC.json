But these volunteers are increasingly older, with fewer young people signing up than previous decades. Higher cost of living and a diminishing rural population has made volunteering less appealing than it used to be.

Against her husband's wishes, she trains to become a solar technician. In doing so, she initiates a shift in patriarchal traditions.\n\nIn the former Fulbe kingdom of \"Fouta Toro” on the border between Senegal and Mauritania, there are villages so remote that the nearest town is several hours away by car. There is no connection to the electricity grid here. Néné lives in one of these villages. At the market, she heard about an NGO that gives women the opportunity to learn about solar energy. Néné decides to visit the NGO: Her village needs electricity.\n\nBefore Néné, no woman had ever left her village, attended school or learned anything other than how to feed animals, cultivate fields, look after children and prepare food. Néné's husband doesn't want to let her go, but she resists his wishes. She decides to train as a solar technician.\n\nNéné is not alone - other women will be taking part in the training alongside her. As they board the minibus bound for the city, their first step into a new life begins. At the training center, they experience running water and electricity for the first time. The sea and the hustle and bustle of the big city are also new to them.\n\nFour months later, the women return to the village, bringing with them much-desired know-how. They explain how the houses can be supplied with solar energy. Little by little, solar power is finding its way into people's everyday lives. Through their actions and their training, the women subtly raise questions about the meaning of modernity -- and the position of women in society.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #senegal \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Featuring intimate stories and expert voices, the film highlights the struggles and triumphs of caregivers nationwide. \n\nThe two-hour documentary is centered on the personal experiences of caregivers providing for loved ones, and the challenges and triumph they face each day. As the number of caregivers declines, and the number of individuals requiring care in our country increases, the challenges grow. Caregivers require differing types and levels of support. At times, the burdens of caregiving can seem unbearable, regardless of resources. The “needs gap” for information may be greater for caregivers than it is for care recipients. The film will explore these issues and shine a light on innovation for 21st century caregiving.

At a conference, an attendee noticed that my badge said \"architect\" and told me \"I want to be an architect too, but I don't know enough about Kubernetes yet\".\n\nArchitecture, in the systems age, is not (just) Kubernetes. It's not the implementation of any particular toolset. Architecture is designing relationships between parts and adapting those relationship patterns as circumstances change. This requires engaging our mental models and working together to transform them.\n\nThe architecture skillset is socio-technical -- a blend of social and technology skills. It is a way of thinking and communicating. In the modern age, there is no division between the way we think together and the code running in production. Our thinking designs our architecture.\n\nArchitecture is structuring good systems thinking.\n\nIn this talk, I will admit that sometimes architecture is Kubernetes. And share five essential qualities that make a good architect a great architect, regardless of the toolset they employ.

Why does it need extra dimensions? Neil deGrasse Tyson and comedian Chuck Nice welcome theoretical physicist and mathematician Lara Anderson to guide us through string theory, higher dimensions, and finding a unifying theory of everything.\n\nCould it be the long-sought bridge between quantum mechanics and Einstein’s theory of gravity? We explore the problem between relativity and quantum physics, and why things break down when combined. Could strings be the key to unifying these two frameworks? How do strings explain particles? And if they’re so small we can’t detect them, how can we confirm the theory?\n\nHave we reached a fundamental particle yet? Lara walks us through the geometry of hidden additional dimensions and how to get around untestable theories. Learn about the math behind string theory and the vision Chuck had about the dimensionality of the universe. Can you have two time dimensions? Or a compactified time dimension? Discover how there are an infinite number of quantum theories for not our universe and what it means to consider a spherical cow. Can string theory produce the particle physics we see? \n\nWe tackle string theory skepticism, the “string landscape,” and the unexpected discoveries made along the way, like the holographic principle to dualities that link seemingly unrelated theories. What does it mean when two different geometries produce the same physics? And is string theory actually connected to the physics we observe? Can AI help us navigate the math? Plus, we discuss the topology of knots and why you can tie a knot in four dimensions.

The conflict in Ukraine has shown that warfare is changing. Can the German armed forces keep up?\n\nNew weaponry is being developed: from drones to artificial intelligence and automatic missile defense systems. Germany’s military, the Bundeswehr, is rearming on a large scale while assessing its future priorities. For example, are expensive tanks still suitable for battle when they can be destroyed by cheap drones? And what future role will multi-million-euro fighter planes play?\nAnalysts say that Russia will be in a position to attack NATO territory in five to eight years' time. That’s led high-ranking German military officials to call for the country to be sufficiently armed by 2029. But how realistic is that goal?\n\nAnother concern is the risk of collateral damage caused by the misjudgments of artificial intelligence. Previously, it was hoped that modern weapons like drones would require fewer soldiers on the frontlines. But experts now believe these more complicated weapons will require more maintenance and therefore more personnel. According to military experts, modern warfare will ironically demand more soldiers than before.\n\nHow are Germany, NATO and Russia positioned militarily? Who is spending vast sums on which technologies? And just how much weaponry is actually sensible or justifiable?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #nato \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.
